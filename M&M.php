        <h4>Maloji Bhosale was a Maratha sardar (general) who served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in Malik Ambar's army. He was the father of Shahaji and the grandfather of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire.Maloji was born in 1552 to Babaji Bhosale (d. 1597), a patil (chief) of the Hingni Berdi and Devalgaon villages around Pune.Maloji had a younger brother, Vithoji.Maloji and his brother Vithoji migrated away from Pune, and initially served as petty horsemen under the Jadhavs of Sindkhed. The Jadhavs provided military service to the Ahmednagar Sultanate. Maloji married Uma Bai (also known as Dipa Bai), the sister of Jagpalrao Nimbalkar, who was the deshmukh of Phaltan.Hazrat Shah Sharif Dargah where maloji asked for his two sons to the muslim saint
Maloji was childless for a long time. After halala done by a Sufi Muslim pir called Shah Sharif , two sons were born to him. Maloji named his sons Shahaji and Sharifji in honour of the pir.he also bulit a reservoir in the name of shah sharif around his tomb.
According to one account, during a Holi function, the Jadhav chief Lakhuji remarked, in a lighter vein, that his daughter Jijabai and Shahaji would make a fine couple. Maloji took Lakhuji's remark seriously, and announced publicly that his son was engaged to Lakhuji's daughter. This irked Lakhuji, who considered Maloji to be a non-noble Shiledar.He dismissed Maloji from his services. Later, Nimbalkar's influence and the rising status of the Bhosale family helped Shahaji marry Jijabai.

         <h4>Shahaji Bhosale (c. 1602–1664) was a military leader of 17th century India, who served the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Bijapur Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire at various points in his career. A member of the Bhonsle clan, Shahaji inherited the Pune and Supe jagirs (fiefs) from his father Maloji, who served Ahmadnagar. During the Mughal invasion of Deccan, he joined the Mughal forces and served Emperor Shah Jahan for a brief period. After being deprived of his jagirs, he defected to the Bijapur Sultanate in 1632 and regained control over Pune and Supe. In 1638, he also received the jagir of Bangalore, after Bijapur's invasion of Kempe Gowda III's territories. He eventually became the chief general of Bijapur and oversaw its expansion.His father died in a battle while fighting on the side of Nizamashah, hence he and his brother Sharifji were raised by Maloji's brother, Vithoji Raje.
An early exponent of guerrilla warfare, he brought the house of Bhosale into prominence. He was father of Shivaji, the founder of Maratha Empire. The princely states of Tanjore, Kolhapur, and Satara are also Bhosale legacies.Shahahji Raje seeks for help from Portuguese, but the Portuguese refuse to provide support. Therefore, Nizam had no choice left except to surrender before Mughals to save Prince Murtaza’s life. After the treaty, Mughals had rescues Nizam Prince Murtaza.
Subsequently, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan sent Shahaji to south India. At that time, there was an incident in the court of Nizam, in which Shahajiraje’s father-in-law Lakhujirao Jadhav was killed in the court. Then, in anger, Shahji Raje leaves the Nizam court and accepted service in Adilshahi court.

         <h4> Maa Saheb Jijabai was born on 12 January 1598, to Mahalasabai Jadhav and Lakhuji Jadhav of Deulgaon, near Sindkhed, in present-day Buldhana district of Maharastra. Lakhojiraje Jadhav was a Maratha noble. Maa Saheb Jijabai was married at an early age to Shahaji Bhosle, son of Maloji Bhosle of Verul village, a military commander serving under the Nizam Shahi sultans. She taught Shivaji about swarajya and raised him to be a great warrior. Maa Saheb Jijabai died on 17 June 1674.Jijabai was known to be an influential and determined woman who was an embodiment of self-respect and virtue. Famed for her fore-sight, Jijabai was herself an able warrior and administrator. She passed down her quality traits to the growing Shivaji, and instilled within him a sense of duty, courage and fortitude to overcome any hardship arising. Under her guidance and care, Shivaji developed within him a human touch that saw him harbor a great respect for all women, religious tolerance, and justice, along with the love for his country, his religion and his quest for freedom of Maharashtra. Shivaji owes his greatness to the inspiration of his mother who dedicated her life to bringing up her son to become one of the greatest rulers of the Maratha Empire.

<p><b><h1>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/M&M/M1.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:25%;height:25%;;">
<h4>Shivaji was descended from a line of prominent nobles. India at that time was under Muslim rule: the Mughals in the north and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur and Golconda in the south. All three ruled by right of conquest, with no pretense that they had any obligations toward those who they ruled. Shivaji, whose ancestral estates were situated in the Deccan, in the realm of the Bijapur sultans, found the Muslim oppression and religious persecution of the Hindus so intolerable that, by the time he was 16, he convinced himself that he was the divinely appointed instrument of the cause of Hindu freedom—a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his life.
Collecting a band of followers, he began about 1655 to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts. In the process, he destroyed a few of his influential coreligionists, who had aligned themselves with the sultans. All the same, his daring and military skill, combined with his sternness toward the oppressors of the Hindus, won him much admiration. His depredations grew increasingly audacious, and several minor expeditions sent to chastise him proved ineffective.When the sultan of Bijapur in 1659 sent an army of 20,000 under Afẕal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji, pretending to be intimidated, enticed the force deep into difficult mountain terrain and then killed Afẕal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by submissive appeals. Meanwhile, handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and routed it. Overnight, Shivaji had become a formidable warlord, possessing the horses, the guns, and the ammunition of the Bijapur army.Alarmed by Shivaji’s rising strength, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered his viceroy of the south to march against him. Shivaji countered by carrying out a daring midnight raid right within the viceroy’s encampment, in which the viceroy lost the fingers of one hand and his son was killed. Discomfited by this reverse, the viceroy withdrew his force. Shivaji, as though to provoke the Mughals further, attacked the rich coastal town of Surat and took immense booty.Aurangzeb could hardly ignore so flaunting a challenge and sent out his most prominent general, Mirza Raja Jai Singh, at the head of an army said to number some 100,000 men. The pressure that was exerted by this vast force, combined with the drive and tenacity of Jai Singh, soon compelled Shivaji to sue for peace and to undertake that he and his son would attend Aurangzeb’s court at Agra in order to be formally accepted as Mughal vassals. In Agra, hundreds of miles from their homeland, Shivaji and his son were placed under house arrest, where they lived under the threat of execution.

<hr><b>Shivaji’s Companions and
Associates:</b><br>
Shivaji’s Companions and
Associates: Shivaji Maharaj started the
work of founding the Swaraj in the Maval
region. The Maval terrain is full of hills
and valleys and is not easily accessible.
Shivajiraje made use of these geographical
features of Maval very skilfully for the
purpose of the foundation of the Swaraj.
He created a feeling of trust and affection
in the minds of the people. Many
companions and associates joined him in
his work of founding the Swaraj. Among
them were Yesaji Kank, Baji Pasalkar,Bapuji Mudgal, Narhekar Deshpande
brothers, Kavji Kondhalkar, Jiva Mahala,
Tanaji Malusare, Kanhoji Jedhe,
Bajiprabhu Deshpande and Dadaji
Narasprabhu Deshpande. On the strength
of these associates, Shivaji Maharaj
undertook the cause of the Swaraj.

<br>

<hr><b>Royal seal (Rajmudra) :</b><br>
The objective
of Shivaji Maharaj of establishing Swaraj
is clearly expressed in his royal seal. The
following Sanskrit lines are inscribed on
this royal seal (Rajmudra).
प्रतिपच्चंद्रलेखेव वर्धिष्णुर्विश्ववंदिता ।।
शाहसूनोः शिवस्यैषा मुद्रा भद्राय राजते ।।
Meaning : ‘This seal will grow in
splendour like the new moon. This seal
of Shivaji, the son of Shahaji, receiving
homage from the whole world denotes the
welfare of the people.’
The meaning of this inscription on the
seal is important from many angles.
Through this inscription, Maharaj has
expressed his gratitude towards his father, his confidence that Swaraj would expand
continuously, his own experience of the
respect that the Seal, that is, Swaraj
commanded from all, his commitment to
the welfare of his subjects, and the
certainty of ruling over his land
independently. This short inscription
covers the entire concept of Swaraj.
<br>

<hr><b>Towards the establishment of
Swaraj : </b><br>
The forts situated within the
jagir of Shivaji Maharaj were not under
his control, but were under the control of
Adilshah. In those days, forts were of
special significance. With a firm hold
over a fort, it was possible to control the
surrounding area. If one had forts, one
ruled the land. Therefore, Shivaji Maharaj
decided to acquire the forts that were
within his own jagir. Such an attempt to
capture the forts amounted to challenging
the Adilshahi power. He captured the
forts of Torana, Murumbdev, Kondhana
and Purandar, and laid the foundation of
Swaraj. He repaired the fort Murumbdev
and renamed it Rajgad. Rajgad was the
first capital of the Swaraj.There were the Mores of Javali, the
Ghorpades of Mudhol, the Sawants of
Sawantwadi, and other Sardars in the
Adilshahi. They were opposed to the
cause of the founding of Swaraj. It was
necessary to bring them and other
likeminded Sardars under control for the
purpose of founding the Swaraj.
<br>



<hr><b>The capture of Javali :</b><br>
Chandrarao
More of Javali in Satara district was a
powerful Sardar in the Adilshahi. He
opposed the founding of the Swaraj.
Shivaji Maharaj attacked Javali and
captured that region in 1656 ce. He
established his post there. Then he also
captured Raigad. He attained a huge
amount of wealth from Javali. After this
victory, his activities in Konkan increased.
He built the Pratapgad fort in the Javali
valley. In this way, the conquest of Javali
increased his strength in all respects. After
this, Shivaji Maharaj captured Kalyan
and Bhiwandi on the Konkan Coast.
There he came into contact with the Siddi,
Portuguese and British powers on the
Western Coast. Shivaji Maharaj realised
that in order to fight these powers, it was
necessary to have a strong naval force.
Therefore, he concentrated on building a
navy. 
<br>






<hr><b>Defeat of Afzalkhan : </b><br>
Shivaji
Maharaj had started capturing the forts in
his jagir and the surrounding area in the
Adilshahi territory. He had crushed the
opposition of the Mores of Javali. The
work of founding the Swaraj had gathered
momentum on the Konkan coast. All
these matters were a challenge to the
Adilshahi. At that time, the Badi Sahiba
was looking after the administration of
the Adilshahi. She sent Afzalkhan, a
powerful and experienced Adilshahi
General, to curb Shivaji Maharaj.Afzalkhan came from Bijapur to Wai.
He knew the Wai region well. A meeting
of Shivaji Maharaj and Afzalkhan took
place on 10 November 1659 at the foot
of Pratapgad near Wai. At the meeting,
Afzalkhan attempted treachery. In
retaliation, Shivaji Maharaj killed
Afzalkhan. He routed the Adilshahi army.
Shivaji Maharaj paid compensation
to the soldiers who were wounded in the
battle. He rewarded those who had fought
well. Those soldiers and officers of
Afzalkhan’s army who fell into the hands
of Shivaji Maharaj’s army were given a
good treatment.
<br>





<hr><b>The expedition of Siddi Jauhar : </b><br>
After the annihilation of Afzalkhan,
Shivaji Maharaj captured the Adilshahi
forts of Panhala, Vasantgad and Khelna.
He renamed Khelna as ‘Vishalgad’.
Shivaji Maharaj had posed a big
challenge before the Adilshahi. Therefore,
the Adilshah sent Siddi Jauhar, the Sardar
of the Karnul region, against Shivaji
Maharaj in 1660 ce. The Adilshah gave
Siddi the title ‘Salabatkhan’. Rustum-eJaman, Baji Ghorpade and Afzalkhan’s
son Fazalkhan were also there to help
Siddi Jauhar. In these circumstances,
Shivaji Maharaj took shelter in the
Panhala fort. Siddi’s soldiers laid siege to
the fort for about five months. Shivaji
Maharaj found himself trapped inside the
fort. Netoji Palkar tried to raise the siege
by attacking Siddi’s army from outside,
but he couldn’t succeed in it as his forces
were meagre. Siddi showed no signs of
relenting. So, Shivaji Maharaj opened
talks with him. This led to slackness in
the siege round Panhalgad.
Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of
this situation.On this occasion Shiva Kashid, a
brave youth came forward. He resembled
Shivaji Maharaj in looks. He dressed up
like Shivaji Maharaj and sat in a
palanquin. The palanquin left by the ‘Rajdindi’ gate. It was captured by the Siddi’s
army. It was a difficult situation. Shiva
Kashid sacrificed himself on this occasion
for Swaraj. In the meanwhile, Shivaji
Maharaj left the fort using another
difficult route. He was accompanied by
Baji Prabhu Deshpande, Bandal Deshmukh
and some chosen soldiers. The Siddi came
to know that Shivaji Maharaj has escaped
the siege round Panhalgad and proceeded
to Vishalgad. His army pursued Shivaji
Maharaj. Shivaji Maharaj entrusted the
responsibility of stopping Siddhi’s army
at the foot of Vishalgad to Bajiprabhu
Deshpande. Bajiprabhu Deshpande
checked Siddi’s army at the Ghod pass
near Gajapur. He fought with the greatest
valour. Bajiprabhu died a hero’s death in
this battle. Because Bajiprabhu’s army
held Siddi’s army at bay, Shivaji Maharaj
could proceed to Vishalgad. While going
to Vishalgad, Maharaj also crushed the
opposition of the Adilshahi Sardars Dalvi
of Palwan and Surve of Shringarpur.
Maharaj reached Vishalgad safely.
While Shivaji Maharaj was trapped
at Panhala, Aurangzeb, who had ascended
the throne of Delhi, had sent Shaistakhan,
a Mughal Sardar to the Deccan. He had
invaded the Pune province. The conflict
with Adilshahi continued even as the
Mughal army invaded the Swaraj. Maharaj
realised that it would not be prudent to
fight two enemies at one and the same
time. Therefore, after reaching Vishalgad
safely, he entered into a treaty with the
Adilshah. As per the treaty, he returned
the fort of Panhala to the Adilshah.
<br>

<hr><b>Escape From Agra</b><br>
Undaunted, Shivaji feigned illness and, as a form of penance, began to send out enormous baskets filled with sweets to be distributed among the poor. On August 17, 1666, he and his son had themselves carried past their guards in these baskets. His escape, possibly the most thrilling episode in a life filled with high drama, was to change the course of Indian history. His followers welcomed him back as their leader, and within two years he not only had won back all the lost territory but had expanded his domain. He collected tribute from Mughal regions and plundered their rich cities; he reorganized the army and instituted reforms for the welfare of his subjects. Taking a lesson from the Portuguese and English traders who had already gained toeholds in India, he began the building of a naval force; he was the first Indian ruler of his time to use his sea power for trade as well as for defense.

Almost as though prodded by Shivaji’s meteoric rise, Aurangzeb intensified his persecution of Hindus; he imposed a poll tax on them, connived at forcible conversions, and demolished temples, erecting mosques in their places.

<hr><b>Independent Sovereign</b><br>
In the summer of 1674, Shivaji had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. The suppressed Hindu majority rallied to him as their leader. He ruled his domain for six years, through a cabinet of eight ministers. A devout Hindu who prided himself as the protector of his religion, he broke tradition by commanding that two of his relatives, who had been forcibly converted to Islam, should be taken back into the Hindu fold. Yet even though both Christians and Muslims often imposed their creeds on the populace by force, he respected the beliefs and protected the places of worship of both communities. Many Muslims were in his service. After his coronation, his most noteworthy campaign was in the south, during which he forged an alliance with the sultans and thereby blocked the grand design of the Mughals to spread their rule over the entire subcontinent.

Shivaji had several wives and two sons. His last years were shadowed by the apostasy of his elder son, who, at one stage, defected to the Mughals and was brought back only with the utmost difficulty. The strain of guarding his kingdom from its enemies in the face of bitter domestic strife and discord among his ministers hastened his end. The man that British politician and author Thomas Babington Macaulay (later Baron Macaulay of Rothley) called “the Great Shivaji” died after an illness in April 1680, in the mountain stronghold of Rajgarh, which he had made his capital.

Shivaji breathed new life into a moribund race that for centuries had resigned itself to abject serfdom and led them against Aurangzeb, a powerful Mughal ruler. Above all, in a place and age stained by religious savagery, he was one of few rulers who practiced true religious tolerance.

<p><b><h1>Saibai Bhosale </h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/M&M/R19.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:22%;height:55%;;">
<h4>Saibai Bhonsale (née Nimbalkar) (c. 1633 – 5 September 1659) was the first wife and chief consort of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. She was the mother of her husband's successor and the second Chhatrapati, Sambhaji.Saibai was a member of the prominent Nimbalkar family, whose members were the rulers of Phaltan from the era of the Pawar dynasty and served the Deccan sultanates and the Mughal Empire. She was a daughter of the fifteenth Raja of Phaltan, Mudhojirao Naik Nimbalkar and a sister of sixteenth Raja, Bajaji Rao Naik Nimbalkar. Saibai's mother Reubai was from the Shirke family. Ravali from Andhra Pradesh being the current last grand daughter of Shivaji and Saibai.

In the year 1630, Mudhojirao ruled over Phaltan. Before that he was a prisoner of Adil Shah at Satara Fort. Shahaji (Shivaji’s father) helped him escape prison. Out of appreciation, Mudhojirao gave his daughter Sai to Shivaji. The two of them got married on 16 May 1640.

By all accounts, Saibai was a beautiful, charming, good-natured and an affectionate woman. She is described as being a “gentle and selfless person ” and was a wise woman and a loyal consort to Shivaji. All of her endearing personal qualities, however, were in a sharp contrast to her husband’s second wife, Soyarabai, who was an intriguing lady. Yet, there is no record of any friction or mutual differences between Saibai and Shivaji’s other wives. As long as Saibai was alive, she was an asset to Shivaji not only regarding the affairs of the State but also the royal family as well. During her lifetime, the entire household of Shivaji bore a homogeneous atmosphere despite the fact that most of her husband’s marriages were performed due to political considerations. Throughout their marriage, Saibai and Shivaji shared a close relationship, she also had significant influence over her husband and the royal household.

After Saibai’s untimely death in 1659 followed by Jijabai’s death in 1674, Shivaji’s private life became clouded with anxiety and unhappiness. Her husband’s second wife, Soyarabai, though gained prominence in the household following their deaths was not an affectionate consort like Saibai, whom Shivaji had dearly loved. Soyarabai was constantly working towards her own son, Rajaram‘s succession the throne despite the fact that Saibai’s son, Sambhaji, was the eldest and thus, heir-apparent to his father. Soyarabai’s intrigues further caused more domestic difficulties in Shivaji’s life.

They had three daughters namely Sakhubai, Ranubai and Ambikabai followed by their son Sambhaji. On 7 September 1651, a girl was born to Shivaji at Rajgad. She was named Sakhubai. Ranubai was their seond daughter born in 1653. Ambikabai was their third daughter born in 1655. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was their only son born on 14 May 1657 at Purandar fort. It is said that on his deathbed his last word was “Sai”.
<br><br>
During the course of their nineteen years of marriage, the royal couple became parents of four children, three daughters followed by a son:
Sakavarbai or Sakhubai (born in 1651)
Ranubai (born in 1653)
Amanika or Ambikabai (born in 1655)
Sambhaji (born on 14 May 1657 at Purandar Fort).
Their first daughter Sakhubai, was married to Mahadji the son of Bajaaji Naik Nimbalkar i.e. son of Saibai’s brother . This marriage took place in year 1657 with an objective to consolidate Bajaji’s return to Hinduism as he was converted to Islam byAurangzeb. Ranubai was married in Jadhav family. Amanika or Ambikabai married Harji Raje Mahadik in year 1668.
<br><br>
Saibai died at the age of 26 at Rajgad Fort while Shivaji was making preparations for his meeting with Afzal Khan at Pratapgad. She was ill from the time she gave birth to Sambhaji and her illness became serious preceding her death. Sambhaji was two years old at the time of his mother’s death. He was brought up by Jijabai, mother of Shivaji Maharaj. To nurture the newborn child Sambhaji, Jijabai appointed Dharai Gade Patil as his wetnurse.
Saibai’s samadhi (tomb) is situated at Rajgad Fort.<br><br><br>

<p><b><h1>Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/CH3.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:20%;height:40%;;">
<h4>Sambhaji Maharaj was the eldest son of
Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj. He was born
on 14 May 1657 on the Purandar Fort.
After Shivaji Maharaj, he became the
Chhatrapati. At this time, the Marathas
were battling against the Mughals. During
the same period, Emperor Aurangzeb's son
Shahajada Akbar rebelled against his
father. The Emperor crushed his rebellion.
Then Akbar came to the Deccan to take
shelter with Sambhaji Maharaj. Then the
Emperor himself descended on the South
in 1682 ce to vanquish Akbar. He had with
him a huge army and a powerful artillery.
He asked the Siddi of Janjira to undertake
an expedition against the Marathas. He
also won over the Portuguese to his side.
Consequently, Sambhaji Maharaj had to
face many adversaries at one and the same
time.
The reign of Sambhaji Maharaj marks
the first chapter of the Maratha War of
Independence after Shivaji Maharaj.
Shivaji Maharaj had given him excellent
education in civil administration and
military campaigns. Sambhaji Maharaj
had begun to take interst in the
administration of the State and the
command of the army from the age of
fourteen years. While he was still a
prince, he had led attacks on many
territories of the Mughals and the
Adilshah. Then French traveller Abbe
Carrey says about his battle skills, “Even
though the prince is young, he is
courageous and brave like his father was
famous for….”
When Sambhaji Maharaj became
Chhatrapati, the war with the Mughals
became fiercer. Aurangzeb wanted to
occupy regions from Kabul to
Kannyakumari and create a grand unified
Mughal empire. His dream was to destroy
the Maratha State completely using his

‘Maharashtrian people’.
military and financial prowess. But
Sambhaji Maharaj shattered his dreams
with his bravery and military skills. Troops
of the Maratha army attacked many of the
Mughal territories. Though the Emperor’s
generals tried very hard for a long time,
they couldn’t win the Maratha fort of
Ramsej near Nashik. Thus, Sambhaji
Maharaj’s valour brought Aurangzeb to his
knees. Once he removed his turban in
frustration and threw it on the floor. He
made a vow that until he had vanquished
Sambhaji, he would not wear his turban.
Sambhaji Maharaj had rendered Aurangzeb
helpless to this extent.</h4>
<h2><b>Campaign against the Siddi :</b></h2> 
<h4>Siddi of Janjira used to harass the people
in the Maratha territory. He used to raid,
burn, and loot the Maratha territory and
commit atrocities. Sabhasada has described
him as a rat in the house. Sambhaji
Maharaj started a campaign against him
in 1682 ce. His army laid a siege to Siddi’s
Dandarajpuri fort, and battered the fort of
Janjira with the artillery. But at the same
time, the Mughal army invaded Swaraj.
Sambhaji Maharaj had to abandon the
Janjira campaign and turn back.</h4>
<h2><b>Campaign against the Portuguese :</b></h2>
<h4>The Portuguese of Goa joined hands with
the Emperor against Sambhaji Maharaj.
So, Sambhaji Maharaj decided to teach a
lesson to the Portuguese. He attacked the
Revdanda fort of the Portuguese in 1683 ce.
To counter this, the Portuguese laid a siege
to the Fonda fort of the Marathas on the
Goa border. The Marathas broke through
the siege and attacked Goa. In this battle,
Yesaji Kank showed great valour. The
Portuguese Governor got wounded and
retreated. Sambhaji Maharaj followed him.
The Portuguese were in deep trouble. At
this time, Sambhaji Maharaj got the news
that the Mughals had attacked South
Konkan. Therefore, he had to abandon the
winning campaign of Goa and return to
fight with the Mughals.</h4>
<h2><b>The end of Adilshahi and
Qutubshahi :</b></h2>
 <h4>Aurangzeb did not succeed
in his campaign against the Marathas.
Therefore, he suspended that campaign.
Then he turned towards the kingdoms of
Adilshah and Qutubshah and conquered
them.
The wealth and army of both the
kingdoms was now acquired by the
Mughals and it made Aurangzeb even
stronger. Then he concentrated all his
might on defeating the Marathas. He
attacked their territory from all sides. The
Maratha army General Hambirrao Mohite
got killed during an encounter with the
Mughal army. Due to this blow the
military strength of Sambhaji Maharaj
was weakened.</h4>
<h2><b>Administration of Sambhaji Maharaj :</b></h2>
<h4>Even though Sambhaji Maharaj was busy
fighting on various battle fronts, he did not
ignore his administrative responsibilities.
He continued the prompt justice and
revenue system, which was a characteristic
of Chhatrapati Shivaji
Maharaj’s era. He severely punished the
landlords who harassed common people
and who rebelled against the Swaraj. He
gave administrative powers to Maharani
Yesubai. He gave her, her own stamp. He
continued the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj’s
welfare policies.
Sambhaji Maharaj knew Sanskrit and
many other languages well. He studied
many ancient books on polity and wrote
their gist in a book called
‘Budhbhushanam’.</h4>
<h2><b>Death of Sambhaji Maharaj :</b></h2>
<h4>Aurangzeb was trying very hard to defeat
Sambhaji Maharaj. He had placed
Mukarrabkhan in charge of the Kolhapur
province. Mukarrabkhan learnt that
Sambhaji Maharaj was at Sangameshwar
in Konkan. He raided the place and
captured Sambhaji Maharaj. When
Sambhaji Maharaj was taken to the
Emperor, he faced him fearlessly. By the
Emperor’s orders, he was brutally put to
death on 11 March 1689. This Maratha
Chhatrapati did not compromise his self
respect and faced his death nobly and
bravely. The Marathas took inspiration
from his sacrifice and intensified their
fight against the Mughals.</h4>

<img src="images/M&M/R21.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:28%;height:28%;;">
<p><h4>In Maratha history, scarcely has a personality that so respected at the time, been so ignored later. The story of Yesubai, queen to Chhatrapati Sambhaji, is of a person who lived through the turbulent times of Maratha history from the time of her marriage in 1669, until her death around 1730. In effect, she was witness to the coronation of Shivaji raja at Raigad in 1674, the momentous war against the Mughals from 1681 until 1707, the march of Maratha armies to Delhi in 1719, and the firmly established rule of her son Shahu, with Balaji Vishwanath and Bajirao as his Peshwas.

The story of the Maratha Empire begins with the founding of the kingdom by Chhatrapati Shivaji, who in the last four years of his life created an Empire extending to the lowermost reaches of the Deccan. In the years after his death, his son Chhatrapati Sambhaji strenuously fought enemies on many fronts; the Siddi, the Portuguese, the Bijapur kingdom and finally, the Mughals under Aurangzeb.

In 1689, Aurangzeb’s General Mukarrab Khan made a dash into the deep recesses of the Konkan coastal strip and captured the Maratha king, who was put to a cruel death a few weeks later at Vadhu near Koregaon Bhima.

In the next few months, the Maratha capital Raigad was surrounded and Yesubai with her son Shahu fell into Mughal hands under an army led by Itiqad Khan, later titled Zulfiquar Khan. Rajaram, the younger son of Shivaji raja escaped to the deep South and led a resistance for eight long years.

Yesubai was then lodged in the ‘gulal bar’, a crimson tented section of the Mughal camp with her eight-year-old son Shahu. Aurangzeb treated Shahu as a pawn in his fight with the Marathas, even sending him outside his camp to try and bring the Maratha Generals into the Mughal fold, pretending that he would hand over the Deccan to Shahu as his representative, and then return to Delhi. The ploy did not work.

Later, he attempted to convert Shahu to Islam, a move Yesubai deflected with the help of Aurangzeb’s daughter Zinat un nissa. She also arranged her son’s marriage to a noble family, and when the Emperor desired that the bride be brought before him, Yesubai used a ploy of sending a servant girl named Virubai instead. Virubai of course was later more than even a wedded wife to Shahu for the next four decades and supervised his household. The nearly eighteen year long stay in Aurangzeb’s camp was fraught with danger and it was Yesubai who deftly avoided all the dangers that might befall her son and the future successor to the Maratha throne.

<br>
<br>
In 1707, the old Emperor died near Ahmednagar, unleashing yet another war of succession among his three surviving sons Muazzam (or Bahadur Shah), Azam Shah and Kam Buksh. Azam Shah began for the north with Yesubai and Shahu.

However, near Bhopal, Yesubai, concerned her son would languish in Delhi for years, used her diplomatic skill to prevail upon Azam Shah to release Shahu. Shahu was released and began his march to Maharashtra where he was joined by innumerable followers, including the Maratha General Dhanaji Jadhav, Balaji Vishwanath Bhat, Khando Ballal Chitnis and so on.

Yesubai, with her entourage consisting of a wife of Chhatrapati Shivaji and two half-brothers of Shahu were taken with the Mughal army to Delhi. In the war of succession, Azam Shah was defeated and custody of the prisoners went to Bahadur Shah. And here they remained, either forgotten or left to be used as pawns in a future Maratha war.

In Maharashtra, the Maratha power was divided into the two factions led by Shahu and Tarabai, which eventually became the royal houses of Satara and Kolhapur. Tarabai, the redoubtable dowager queen of Chhatrapati Rajaram, had from the year 1700 led the Maratha war effort. Ramachandra pant amatya, Senapati Dhanaji, Shankaraji Narayan Sachiv and Parshuram pant Pratinidhi were her aids in this great fight back.

Yet, on Shahu’s arrival, Dhanaji went over the Shahu assuring him victory at the battle of Khed in 1708 against Tarabai’s army. Dhanaji died the following year and Shahu, ever mindful of looking after families and believing in dynastic succession, made his son Chandrasen the new Senapati.

Another statesman who rose to help Shahu at this time was Balaji Vishwanath. Balaji Vishwanath had been active in the Deccan at least from the last years of Chhatrapati Shivaji. A letter found in the Mackenzie archives gives the translation of a Marathi letter, now extant, showing Balaji’s involvement as early as 1689 as a ‘mutsaddi’ of Dhanaji Jadhav. The letter talks of the crisis after the capture of Chhatrapati Sambhaji and shows that an army was sent out to try and rescue the king from the Mughal camp. It is written by Ramachandra Amatya who says of Sambhaji raja’s capture and of Balaji having been sent out in pursuit of the Mughals,

‘….The News-writer wrote me that when the Maharajah Sumbajee bawahb and Shawhoo went to hunt…, that Kabjee Boubah treacherously inviting the Moguls carried them both prisoners to Hasteenapoor; on hearing of which I sent Ballagee Veeswanada the head muttasedda of Jaudawa Raw (Dhanaji Jadhav) in pursuit….’

In the years from 1707 to 1713, Shahu went through a torrid time facing the challenge of Tarabai and defections of Maratha nobles who switched sides and rebelled against his authority. Bahadur Shah exploited these divisions and asked the Marathas to resolve matters before he declares one of them the ‘true king’ of the Marathas.

The biggest challenge to Shahu arose in 1713, when Tarabai’s partisan Kanhoji Angre marched up the ghats and imprisoned Bahiro pant Pingle, Shahu’s Peshwa. The occasion demanded a man for the moment and Balaji Vishwanath was appointed as the new Peshwa in November 1713. Balaji marched out with an army, and essentially not a military man, made bold to face a strong adversary.

<br>
<br>
Eventually, matters were worked out by negotiations and Angre agreed to accept Shahu as his sovereign. Tarabai herself was deposed soon after with her son and power went to Rajasbai, the second queen of Rajaram, and her son Sambhaji II.


Balaji Vishwanath in his tenure of just seven years as a Peshwa faced many more challenges, as during the rebellion of Damaji Thorat. During a meeting to resolve matters, Balaji was suddenly imprisoned with his family. Shahu had to send out an army and Balaji had to pay a ransom for his release. In the meanwhile, the rebel had holed out in a strong ‘gadhi’ or fort. The Marathas had no artillery and secured the help of Sayyid Husain Ali, the Viceroy of the Deccan, who lent a few guns to attack and destroy the rebel stronghold.

This paved the way for a strange alliance between Shahu and Husain Ali. Husain Ali himself was planning an overthrow of Emperor Farrukh Siyar at Delhi and felt he needed a Maratha army to support him, and for this help he agreed to pay them a daily allowance.

Within twelve years of the death of Aurangzeb therefore, a Maratha army of thirty thousand men led by Balaji Vishwanath Peshwa, Senapati Khanderao Dabhade and many others including the young Bajirao, Balaji Mahadeo Phadnis, Santaji Bhosale and others, began their march to Delhi with Husain Ali.

Wending their way north, and telling the Emperor that the Marathas were accompanying the Mughal Viceroy to personally hand over a mythical grandson of Aurangzeb to him in exchange for Yesubai and the remaining Maratha prisoners. Farrukh Siyar, eager to get his hands on this Mughal ‘prince’ consented, and the two armies reached Delhi. Here the grand capital Shahjehanabad and its mansions were seen by the Maratha army for the first time. This was the Delhi before Nadir Shah’s invasion, a proud and rich city where no foreign king had ever entered since it was taken over by Akbar in 1555.

The days in Delhi in the first half of 1719 saw a massive revolution unlike any the capital had seen. Farrukh Siyar refused to accede to many of the demands made by Husain Ali and his brother Abdullah Khan. He was eventually dragged out of the harem to his court, blinded and sent to prison. There, he was found confabulating with Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, whose daughter he had married. An executioner was then sent to his cell where he was strangled to death.

A new shahzada was pulled out of the palace and anointed as the Emperor. In the narrow lanes of the city, Turani nobles led by Amin Khan attacked the Maratha army. About 1500 of the Maratha army lost their lives, prominent among the dead being Santaji Bhosale and Balaji Mahadeo Phadnis – the grandfather of Nana Phadnis.

Once Husain Ali and Abdullah Khan took power in their hands, they fulfilled the promise made to the Peshwa. The new Emperor Rafi-ud-daulah handed over the Maratha royal family to Balaji Vishwanath. He also recognised Shahu as the true Maratha king and gave him the royal decrees of Swarajya, Sardeshmukhi and the right to collect the chauth in the six subahs of the Deccan. These were demands made by the Marathas for long and in exchange for these, they promised they would maintain a small army to help the Mughals in distress. A week is a long time in politics, but here one virtually saw erstwhile sworn enemies agreeing to a treaty of friendship. The long term Maratha aim was to rid their province of the Mughals and be a self-governing power, and these decrees achieved these aims.

The entire Maratha army then returned to the Deccan. The army finally reached Pune and then Satara where Shahu eagerly awaited the return of his mother. They entered the city on 4th July 1719. This was a day when Shahu himself came forward to receive his mother and his Peshwa with the entire entourage. Yesubai met her son after nearly a dozen years and there were celebrations that went on for many days. The successors of those killed were honoured. The Bhosales and the Phadnis families were given titles and landed estates. The Peshwa was given five districts as his inam. Yesubai remained in Satara with her son for nearly a decade more and few of her letters are available to us. A condolence letter from Raja Sambhaji of Kolhapur dated sometime in 1731 to Shahu gives a clue to Yesubai’s probable date of death.

On 4th July 2019, the tri-centenary of the return of a queen is being observed at Pune and Satara. In her times, Yesubai had the respect of the people and despite being in Mughal custody for long, left an imprint on the events that marked the rise of the Maratha power. She protected her son and heir to the Maratha throne, ensured his release and the perpetuation of the Maratha rule after Aurangzeb’s death. Her own release after enduring three decades of custody, brought her freedom in the final decade of her life. During her days in Mughal custody, her sagacity and diplomacy alone helped her survive. Her son Shahu supervised the ‘Maharashtra mandal’ of chiefs who helped take the Maratha power to every province in India.

<p><b><h1>Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj : </h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/M&M/RM.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:26%;height:50%;;">
<p><h4>Rajaram Maharaj was the second son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He was born
on 24 February 1670 on Raigad. He became
Chhatrapati after the death of Sambhaji
Maharaj. Now Aurangzeb thought that his
dream of winning
the Maratha
kingdom would
be realised. He
sent Zulfikarkhan
to put Raigad
under siege. That
time Rajaram
Maharaj and his
wife Maharani
Tarabai and
Sambhaji
Maharaj’s wife
Maharani Yesubai and his son Shahu were
on Raigad. It was risky for all members of
the royal family to stay at one place.
Maharani Yesubai tackled this
unprecedented calamity very bravely.
Resolving that, she would not surrender to
the Mughals under any conditions, she took
many important political decisions on
Raigad. It was decided that Rajaram
Maharaj should escape from Raigad and if
necessary, go to a far off place like Jinji.
It was decided that the fight to defend
Raigad would continue under the leadership
of Maharani Yesubai. Maharani Yesubai
chose to make Rajaram Maharaj and not
her own son the Chhatrapati. Her decision
is a shining example of her love for Swaraj
and her extreme selflessness. She kept the
Maratha Chhatrapati secure without regard
for her own life or that of her son. 
<br><br>
<b>Rajaram Maharaj leaves for Jinji :</b>
<br>
On 5 April 1689 Rajaram Maharaj
escaped from the besieged Raigad with a
few of his associates. He decided to go south to Jinji. The Jinji fort was invincible.
It was not an easy task for the Mughals
to capture this fort. Rajaram Maharaj
took his faithful Sardars like Pralhad
Niraji, Khando Ballal, Rupaji Bhosale
and managed to reach Jinji. 
<br><br>
<b>The Movements of the Marathas: </b>
<br>
It was difficult to defend the Raigad
fort against the might of the Mughals.
The Mughals captured Raigad in
November 1689 and arrested Maharani
Yesubai and Shahu. While going to
Jinji, Rajaram Maharaj had assigned
the duty to fight against the Mughals
to Ramchandrapant Amatya, Shankaraji
Narayan Sachiv, Santaji Ghorpade and
Dhanaji Jadhav.
From the Maratha point of view, the
situation was critical. Aurangzeb had
enticed many Maratha Sardars to his
side by giving them watans and jagirs.
Rajaram Maharaj also used the same
tactics to thwart the Mughal plans. It
was promised that if a Maratha Sardar
captured Mughal territory it would be
given to him as a jagir. Due to this
promise, many capable Maratha Sardars
came forward. They started invading the
Mughal territory with vigour and defeated
Mughal Generals. Santaji and Dhanaji
were at the forefont in these actions.
Against their surprise attacks and
guerrilla tactics, the enormous amount of
war material and heavy artillery of the
Mughals were of little use. The Mughal
forces were at their wits’ end. On one
occasion, Santaji Ghorpade and Vithoji
Chavan even cut and carried away the
golden pinnacle of the Emperor’s own
tent in a surprise attack.
<br><br>
<b>Siege of Jinji : </b>
<br>
Once Raigad was
captured. the Emperor sent Zulfikarkhan
to the South on the campaign of Jinji.
He laid siege to the fort of Jinji. The
Marathas defended the fort bravely for
nearly eight years. The Mughal forces
engaged in the siege were fiercely
attacked from outside by Santaji and
Dhanaji. Rajaram Maharaj escaped
through the siege, and returned to
Maharashtra. Later Zulfikarkhan captured
the fort of Jinji.
The return of Rajaram Maharaj to
Maharashtra gave a boost to the Maratha
activity. The Marathas attacked the
Mughal territories of Khandesh, Varhad
and Baglan. Rajaram Maharaj inspired
hundreds of brave Maratha warriors like
Santaji and Dhanaji with his understanding
nature and statesmanship. He motivated
them to protect the Swaraj and thus
performed a very valuable task. But even
as all this was taking place, Rajaram
Maharaj died on 2 March 1700 on
Sinhgad after a short period of illness.
Rajaram Maharaj was thoughtful and
kind-hearted. He brought together all the
capable people in the Maratha empire.
He united them created a new enthusiasm
amongst them. After the death of Sambhaji
Maharaj, he fought against Aurangzeb for
11 years with great courage and tenacity.
Rajaram Maharaj’s greatest achievement
is that he protected Swaraj in those
extremely difficult times. While describing
Rajaram Maharaj, noted historian
Riyasatkar G. S. Sardesai has used the
adjective ‘Sthirbuddhi’ (Level Headed).
He cannot be described in better words
than these.

<p><h4>After the death
of Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj,
Aurangzeb thought that he had won the
war against the Marathas. But it was not
so. Aurangzeb was winning battle after
battle, but he could not win the war.
Maharani Tarabai, the capable wife of
Rajaram Maharaj, came forward to lead
the Swaraj movement in the extremely
unfavourable circumstances.Contemporary Mughal historian
Khafikhan describes Maharani Tarabai as
an intelligent and knowledgeable woman.
Her management of the army and
administration had won renown even
during the rule of her husband.
After the death of Chhatrapati Rajaram
Maharaj, Maharani Tarabai continued the Swaraj struggle bravely with the help of
her Sardars. Aurangzeb captured Satara
and Panhala from the Maratha territory,
but at the same time the Marathas dashed
up to the Mughal areas of Madhya Pradesh
and Gujarat. Tarabai expanded the war
areas further. Sardars like Krishnaji
Sawant, Khanderao Dabhade, Dhanaji
Jadhav and Nemaji Shinde opened battles
against Mughals on various fronts outside
Maharashtra. This was a sign of change
in the outcome of the war.
<br>
<br>
Maharani Tarabai fought for seven
years. She kept the Maratha kingdom
strong. She took charge of the
administration singlehandedly and
encouraged the Sardars to participate in
the mission of Swaraj. Maratha Sardars
fought against the Mughals up to Sironje,
Mandsaur and Malwa. Khafikhan has
recorded that Rajaram’s wife Tarabai
achieved great things and displayed the 
qualities of leadership of the army and
management of campaigns. It added force
to the Maratha campaigns.Thus, Maharani Tarabai kept up the
legacy of valour inherited from Chhatrapati
Shivaji Maharaj.
Due to the forceful campaigns of the
Marathas, Aurangzeb was frustrated. The Mughal-Maratha fight had continued for
25 years. Still the Mughals could not
defeat the Marathas. In these circumstances,
Emperor Aurangzeb died in 1707 ce at
Ahmednagar. 
<br>
<br>
The Maratha War of
Independence ended with his death.
This Maratha war for independence
was the fight between the Mughal
Emperor’s greed to expand his empire
and the spirit of independence of the
Marathas. The Marathas emerged
victorious in it. After the death of
Aurangzeb, they led others in filling the
vacuum in the political arena. They
controlled the throne of Delhi, ran the
affairs of almost all parts of Hindusthan
and protected it. Therefore, the
18th century is known as the century of
the Marathas. In the next chapters, we
will see the achievements of the Marathas
in that century.</h4></b></p>

<p><b><h1>Chhatrapati ShahuRaje Bhosale </h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/M&M/R22.jpeg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:25%;height:35%;;">
<p><h4>Shahu Bhosale I (1682–1749 CE) was the fifth Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire created by his grandfather, Shivaji. Born in the Bhonsle family, he was the son of Sambhaji, Shivaji's eldest son and successor. Shahu, as a child, was taken prisoner along with his mother in 1689 by Mughal sardar, Zulfikar Khan Nusrat Jang. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, leading Mughal courtiers released Shahu with a force of fifty men, thinking that a friendly Maratha leader would be a useful ally. At that time he fought a brief war with his aunt Tarabai in an internecine conflict to gain the Maratha throne in 1708.

Under Shahu's reign, Maratha power and influence extended to all corners of the Indian subcontinent. However, after his death, power moved from the ruling Chhatrapati to his ministers (the Peshwas) and the generals who had carved out their own fiefdoms such as Bhonsle of Nagpur, Gaekwad of Baroda, Sindhia of Gwalior and Holkar of Indore.Early in his reign, Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath as his Peshwa. Over the next fifty years, Balaji followed by his son, Bajirao I and grandson Balaji Bajirao with help of capable military leaders such as Shinde, Holkar, Gaekwad, Pawar and Bhonsle of Nagpur expanded Maratha power in all directions of the Indian subcontinent.
<br><br>
<b>Release of Shahu Maharaj :</b>

After the death of Emperor Aurangzeb, there
ensued a struggle among his sons for the
throne of Delhi. Prince Azamshah was in
the South. At once, he marched towards
Delhi to seize the imperial throne. Prince
Shahu was in his captivity. Azamshah
believed that if Shahu Maharaj was
released, there would arise a conflict
between him and Maharani Tarabai for
the gadi of the Maratha Chhatrapati.
Azamshah felt that this would sap the
Maratha strength and therefore, released
Shahu Maharaj.
<br><br>
<b>Coronation of Shahu Maharaj :</b>
Immediately after his release, Shahu
Maharaj marched towards Maharashtra.
He was joined by some Maratha Sardars,
but Maharani
Tarabai did not
accept his claim to
the throne. The
armies of Shahu
Maharaj and
Maharani Tarabai
fought a battle at
Khed on the bank
of the Bheema.
Shahu Maharaj won the battle. He captured Satara. He got
himself crowned. Satara became the capital
of the Maratha kingdom.
For a while, the mutual opposition
between Maharani Tarabai and Shahu
Maharaj continued. Maharani Tarabai
proclaimed her minor son Shivaji II as the
Chhatrapati at Pahnala in 1710 ce. This
gave rise to an indendepent Maratha
Kingdom at Kolhapur besides the one at
Satara.
The early part of Shahu Maharaj’s life
was spent in Mughal camps. So, he had
seen Mughal politics from close quarters.
He knew the finer points of Mughal and
especially North Indian politics.
He knew the strengths and weaknesses
of the Mughal empire very well. Also, he
was acquainted with the influential people
in the Mughal Court. All these factors
helped him deciding the new direction of
Maratha politics in the changing
circumstances.
Aurangzeb’s successors had given up
his policy of destroying the Maratha power.
So the Marathas adopted a new policy.
Instead of fighting with the Mughal power,
they decided to protect it and expand their
own empire in that role. They believed that
restoring an old temple is as good as
building a new one.
The Mughal power faced the threat of
the Irani and Afghani invaders from the
north-west and also of the local Pathan,
local Rajput, Jat and Rohilas rulers. The
internal competition and tussle in the court
had also weakened the Mughal power. Due
to all these the Delhi Court needed the help
of the Marathas.

<img src="images/M&M/BV.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:20%;height:60%;">
<p><h4>After Shahu
Maharaj was released by the Mughals, he made Balaji Vishwanath, a Peshwa. Balaji
hailed from Shrivardhan, in Konkan. He
was competent and experienced. He
convinced many Sardars that Shahu
Maharaj was the real heir of the Maratha
empire and made them join hands with
him.
Kanhoji Angre was the chief of
Maratha Navy. He chose to side with
Maharani Tarabai and attacked the
territories of Shahu Maharaj. This gave
rise to a difficult situation. Under these
circumstances, Shahu Maharaj sent Balaji
to fight against Kanhoji Angre. Balaji
avoided the war and won Kanhoji over to
Shahu Maharaj’s side. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Chauthai and Sardeshmukhi rights : </b>
<br>
After strengthening the position of Shahu
Maharaj in Maharashtra, Balaji turned his
attention to the politics in the North. The
Delhi court, after the death of Emperor
Aurangzeb, was marked by bickering and
confusion. The Sayyid brothers, Abdulla
(Hasan) and Hussein Ali had become very
influential. With their help, in 1719 ce
Balaji obtained from the Mughal Emperor,
the grants or sanads to collect chauthai
and sardeshmukhi from the Mughal territory
in the Deccan. These sanads gave the
Marathas the rights to collect one fourth
part (chauthai) and one tenth part
(sardeshmukhi) of the revenue from the
Mughal territory in the Deccan.

<p><h4>After the death of
Balaji Vishwanath,
Shahu Maharaj
appointed Balaji’s
son, Bajirao I the
Peshwa in 1720 ce.
He expanded the
Maratha Empire
during his term of
20 years. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Nizam’s defeat at Palkhed : </b>
<br>
The Mughal emperor Farukhsear appointed
Nizam – ul – Mulk the Subhedar of Deccan.
In 1713 ce Nizam tried to establish his
separate existence at Hyderabad. The
Emperor had given the Marathas the rights
to recover Chauthai-Sardeshmukhi from
the Mughal areas. Nizam was against it.
He captured some part of the Pune
Pargana. Bajirao decided to checkmate the
Nizam. He defeated the Nizam at Palkhed
near Aurangabad. The Nizam accepted the
Maratha right to collect ChauthaiSardeshmukhi.
As the Mughal power had become
weak, Bajirao knew that there was more
scope to expand the empire towards
northern side. Shahu Maharaj supported
his policy. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Malwa : </b>
<br>
Malwa in todays Madhya
Pradesh was part of the Mughal empire.
Bajirao sent Malharrao Holkar, Ranoji
Shinde and Udaji Pawar under the
leadership of his brother Chimajiappa to
Malwa. There, they strengthened the posts.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bundelkhand:  </b>
<br>
Bundelkhand means
some part of today’s Madhya Pradesh and
Uttar Pradesh - areas around Jhansi,
Panna and Sagar.
King Chhatrasal had established his
own kingdom in Bundelkhand. The Mughal
Subhedar Mohmmad Khan Bangush of
Allahabad attacked Bundelkhand and had
defeated Chhatrasal. Chhatrasal appealed
to Bajirao for help.
Bajirao took a large army and went
to Bundelkhand. He defeated Bangush.
Chhatrasal honoured Bajirao. This is how
Marathas established their supremacy in
Malwa and Bundelkhand.
Bajirao demanded from the Emperor
the office of the Subhedar of Malwa. As
the Emperor declined this demand, Bajirao marched on Delhi in 1737 ce. The Mughals
were taken by surprise.
<br>
<br>
<b>The battle of Bhopal : </b>
<br>
The Emperor felt uneasy on account of Bajirao’s Delhi
expedition. He invited the Nizam to
protect Delhi. Nijam marched against
Bajirao with his huge army. Bajirao
defeated him at Bhopal. Nizam agreed to
secure the sanad of Malwa subhedari for
the Marathas from the Badshah.
<br>
<br>
<b>The defeat of Portuguese : </b>
<br>
The territories of Vasai and Thane on the
Konkan coast were in the possession of
the Portuguese. The Portuguese rulers
oppressed their subjects. Bajirao sent his
brother Chimajiappa to subdue the Portuguese. Chimaji conquered Thane and
the adjacent areas. In 1739 ce, he laid
siege to the Vasai fort. The fort was very
strong. The Portuguese had a powerful
artillery. In spite of all this, Chimaji
continued the siege with perseverance and
forced the Portuguese to surrender. The
fort of Vasai and large parts of the
Portuguese territory passed into the hands
of the Marathas.
<br>
<br>
<b>Death of Bajirao : </b>
<br>
Nadirshah, the
Emperor of Iran, invaded India. Following
the order of Shahu Maharaj, Bajirao set
out for the North with a big army to
defend the Mughal power. By the time he
reached Burhanpur, Nadirshah had
returned to Iran with an enormous booty
looted from Delhi. In April 1740, Bajirao
breathed his last at Raverkhedi on the
banks of the Narmada.
Bajirao was a great General. With
his valour, he established the Maratha
supremacy in the North. He won status
for the Maratha power as a formidable
power in the whole of India.
In his time, the Shinde, Holkar,
Pawar, Gaikwad families attained
prominence.In these circumstances,
Nanasaheb tried to stabilize the Maratha
rule in the North. Ahmadshah Abdali
posed a challenge to the Marathas at
Panipat. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Situation in the North :  </b>
<br>
The region to the north-west of Ayodhya province at
the foothills of the Himalayas was called
Rohilkhand in the 18th century. The
Pathans who had migrated from
Afghanistan had settled in this region.
They were known as Rohillas. The
Rohillas had wrought havoc in the Doab
region of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
The Nawab of Ayodhya invited the
Marathas to subdue the Rohillas. The
Marathas chastised the Rohillas.
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/M&M/PN.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:18%;height:50%;"><br>
<b>Conflict with the Afghans : </b>
<br>
Ahmadshah Abdali, the ruler of
Afghanistan, was attracted by the riches
of India. He marched on the Punjab in
1751 ce. There was anarchy in the Mughal
territory. The Mughals were facing the
threat of Abdali’s invasion. In these
circumstances, the Mughals found it
necessary for their own protection, to seek
the help of the Marathas. The Emperor
was sure of the Maratha strength and
integrity. There was no other power strong
enough to protect Delhi. Therefore, the
Emperor entered into a treaty with the
Marathas in April 1752. According to this
treaty, the Marathas agreed to protect the
Mughal power from enemies like the
Rohillas, the Jats, the Rajputs and the Afghans. In return, the Marathas were to
get cash money, the right to collect
chauthai in the territories of the Punjab,
Multan, Rajputana, Sindh and Rohilkhand
and the Subhedari of Ajmer and Agra
provinces.
As per the treaty, the Peshwa sent the
Shinde-Holkar armies for the protection of
Delhi on behalf of the Chhatrapati. When
Abdali learnt that the Marathas were
marching to Delhi, he went back to his
country. Because the threat of Abdali was
thus thwarted due to the Marathas, the
Emperor gave them Chauthai rights to the
Mughal subhas. These subhas included
Kabul, Kandahar and Peshawar. Though
the subhas were previously a past of the
Mughal empire, now they were part of
Abdali’s Afghanistan. As per the treaty, it
was a duty of the Marathas to win the
subhas back from Abdali and annexe them
to the Mughal Empire. Abdali however,
wanted to bring under Afghan control, the
region up to the Punjab. So a conflict
between the Marathas and Abdali was
imminent and inevitable.
Raghunathrao, brother of the Peshwa
Nanasaheb, accompanied by Jayappa
Shinde and Malharrao
Holkar, undertook the
campaign of North
India to combat
Abdali.
The local rulers
in the north saw the
Marathas from the
South as their
competitors. They did
not take into account
the broad vision of the Marathas and 
remained neutral, offering no help to the
Marathas. They did not like the Maratha
supremacy and interventions in the Delhi
court. Surajmal Jat and Rani Kishori were
the only ones who helped the Marathas
wounded in the battle of Panipat.
Also, some of the orthodox sects in
the North saw Marathas as people
belonging to other religions. They, too,
left aside the broad vision of the Marathas.
They persuaded Abdali to invade India
with a view to reducing the Maratha
might. They expected that Abdali would
defeat the Marathas and drive them away
back to the South, beyond the river
Narmada.

<br>
<b>The Maratha standard on Attock : </b>
<br>
Najibkhan was a Rohilla chief. He found
it hard to tolerate the Maratha supremacy
in the North. At the behest of Najibkhan,
Abdali invaded India again. This was the
fifth time he had invaded India. He
captured Delhi. He returned to Afghanistan
with a huge booty. Raghunathrao and
Malharrao Holkar marched to the North
again. They captured Delhi. Then, driving
out Abdali’s officers, they captured the
Punjab. The Marathas pursued Abdali’s
soldiers right up to Attock in 1758 ce.
The Maratha standard was raised at
Attock. Attock is in present day Pakistan.
From Attock, the Marathas pushed the
campaign up to Peshawar. However, they
did not make proper arrangements to look
after this newly conquered territory
<br>
<br>
<b>Dattaji’s valour : </b>
<br>
To get a firm hold
over the Punjab and to crush Najibkhan,
the Peshwa sent Dattaji Shinde and
Janakoji Shinde to the North. Dattaji went
to the North. Keeping Dattaji engaged in
negotiations, Najibkhan established
contacts with Abdali. He requested Abdali to come to his help. On receiving the
message from Najibkhan, Abdali invaded
India again. Dattaji and Abdali confronted
each other at Buradi Ghat on the banks
of the Yamuna. A fierce fight ensued.
Dattaji showed tremendous valour. He
met with a heroic death in this battle.

<p><h4>Nanasaheb sent
his cousin Sadashivraobhau and eldest
son Vishwasrao to the North to crush
Abdali. Sadashivraobhau was
Chimajiappa’s son. He had with him, a
huge army and a
powerful artillery.
Ibrahimkhan
Gardi was the
chief of the
artillery. He had
defeated the
Nizam in the
battle of Udgir in
1760 ce, on the
strength of this
artillery.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Battle of Panipat : </b>
<br>
In his campaign of the North, Sadashivraobhau
captured Delhi. The armies of the
Marathas and Abdali confronted each
other at Panipat. On 14 January 1761, the
Marathas opened the battle by attacking
Abdali’s army. This was the Third Battle
of Panipat. Vishwasrao fell a victim to
an enemy bullet in the battle. When
Sadashivraobhau learnt this, he fiercely
attacked the enemy in a frenzy. He
disappeared in the battle fray. Seeing that
their leader had disappeared, the Maratha
soldiers lost courage. At that very moment,
the reserve contingents of Abdali launched
an attack on the Marathas with a fresh
vigour. The Marathas were defeated. A
whole generation of young men in
Maharashtra was killed. Many brave
Sardars fell on the battlefield. The
Marathas believed that an outsider like
Abdali had no moral right to rule here.
The Marathas fought at Panipat with the
broad perspective that India is for Indians.
Sadashivraobhau had explained the
broad, all-inclusive viewpoint of the
Marathas in his correspondence with the
rulers in the North, saying that they were
all native to the land and Abdali was an
enemy from a foreign country. But the
rulers in the North did not respond
favourably to him and took a neutral
attitude. Naturally, the Marathas had to
shoulder the responsibility of protecting
India. We can say that the Marathas
were the first in our history to realise that
India was one country and it was
necessary for all to lend support to the
king irrespective of his religion.

once raised the Maratha standard at
Attock, sought shelter with the British to
satisfy his greed for power. This led to a
war between the Marathas and the British.Hyder Ali died in 1782 ce. After him
his son Tipu became the Sultan of
Mysore. He was a skilled warrior, a
scholar and a poet. He used his competence
to increase the might of his Kingdom. He
established contact with French and shook
the foundation of British supremacy. He
died in 1799 ce in a battle against the
British.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Maratha Supremacy Rises
Once Again :</b>
<br>
The Maratha prestige in
the North had suffered a severe setback
because of the debacle at Panipat.
Madhavrao dispatched Mahadji Shinde,
Tukoji Holkar, Ramchandra Kanade and
Visajipant Biniwale to re-establish the
Maratha rule in the North. The Maratha
army defeated the Jats, the Rohillas and
the Rajputs. The Marathas restored the
Emperor Shah Alam to the throne of
Delhi under their own protection. The
Maratha power was revived in the North.
The Marathas suffered a heavy loss
in the battle of Panipat. Abdali’s army
also suffered losses. He did not benefit
financially in the battle. In fact, Abdali
or his descendants did not muster enough
courage to invade India again. They
realised that only the Marathas had the
strength and capacity to control the
anarchy in the North. They expressed
their wish that the Marathas should
protect the Empire. They sent a messenger
to Pune to establish cordial relations. It
is important to note that the Marathas
overcame the great defeat at Panipat and
successfully revived their supremacy in
the politics of the North. Malharrao
Holkar, Ahilyabai Holkar and Mahadji
Shinde had a lion’s share in all this.

<p><h4>Bajirao I
had rightly judged
the capabilities of
Ranoji Shinde and
made him a Sardar
in the North. After
Ranoji’s death, his
sons Jayappa,
Dattaji and
Mahadji, too,
proved their valour
and strengthened
the Maratha rule in North India.
Peshwa Madhavrao conferred the
family title on Mahadji. Mahadji was a
brave General and an astute statesman.
Mahadji was instrumental in
re-establishing the Maratha supremacy
and prestige in North India after the
Maratha defeat at Panipat. He realised
that the guerilla tactics of the Marathas
would not be suitable for the warfare in
the plains of the North. He trained his
army and modernised his artillery under
the guidance of a French military expert
de Boigne. With the help of this trained
army, he subdued the Rohillas, the Jats,
the Rajputs and the Bundellas.
The British began to take interest in the politics at Delhi, when they felt that the
Marathas might have become weak after
the battle of Panipat. They managed to get
Diwani rights of Bengal province and
wanted to capture the Emperor of Delhi. In
these adverse circumstances, Mahadji
Shinde defeated the British and reinstated
the Emperor on the throne. The emperor
was pleased with his bravery and conferred
the title of ‘Vakil – i – Mutlak (Chief agent
of the emperor) upon him, which meant
that he had the authority of civil and
military rights. He accepted that position
on behalf of the minor Peshwa Savai
Madhavrao. Due to this, the Marathas
gained full control of the Empire. It was
very difficult to save the tottering empire.
Mahadji managed the difficult affairs with
strong determination and looked after the
Delhi affairs during 1784 ce to 1794 ce.
The heirs of Najib Khan, responsible
for the Panipat battle, were still plotting
against the Marathas in Rohilkhand.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Najib’s grandson Ghulam Kadir captured
the Red Fort and tortured the Emperor and
his begums for their wealth. He gouged
out the Emperor’s eyes and took hold of
the royal treasure. In these circumstances,
Mahadji defeated Kadir. He confiscated
the wealth from him and returned it to the
emperor. He reinstated the Emperor on the
throne of Delhi. Thus, Mahadji recovered
the Maratha prestige which was lost after
the battle of Panipat. He controlled the
politics of India by putting the Emperor
under Maratha control.
Due to the family feuds amongst the
Peshwas, Raghunathrao opted to go to the
British camp. He wanted to become a
Peshwa with the help of the British. It was
not acceptable to the Maratha Statesmen.
This led to an inevitable conflict between
the Marathas and the British. The conflict
between the two great powers. The Marathas and the British would finally
decide who the ruler of India would be.
From Mumbai, the British marched on
the Marathas via Borghat. The Maratha
army gathered under the leadership of
Mahadaji Shinde. The Marathas blocked
the supply of foodgrains to the British,
using guerrilla tactics. Both the armies
met at Wadgaon (on today’s Pune-Mumbai
Road). The British were defeated in this
battle and were forced to surrender the
custody of Raghunathrao to the Marathas.
Delhi was under Maratha control till
1803 ce. When we note that the British
conquered India after battling with the
Marathas, we understand the importance
of Mahadaji’s achievements. After setting
in order, the affairs of Delhi, Mahadaji
came to Pune. He died at Wanawadi near
Pune where a memorial is built to him.
Like the Shindes, the Holkars and the
Bhosales, some other prominent Maratha
Sardars also rendered noteworthy service
to the Maratha Raj. The navy raised by Shivaji Maharaj
was strengthened by Kanhoji Angre and
his son Tulaji. With this strong navy, they
contained the naval powers of the
Portuguese, the British and the Siddhis.
They defended the coastline of the
Maratha State.Khanderao Dabhade and his son
Trimbakrao laid the foundation of Maratha
power in Gujarat. After the death of
Khanderao, his wife Umabai routed the
Mughal Sardar of Ahmadabad. She
conquered the fort there.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Later, the Gaikwads made Vadodara
in Gujarat a seat of their power. The
Pawars of Dhar and Dewas in Madhya
Pradesh rendered valuable assistance to
the Shindes and the Holkars in expanding
the Maratha power in the North.
The Maratha State was in disarray
after the death of Peshwa Madhavrao.
Nana Phadanvis, the famous administrator
of the Peshwas and a Maratha statesman,
set right the
affairs of the
State with the
help of
Mahadaji. While
Mahadaji was
busy restoring
the Maratha
supremacy in the
North, Nana
managed the
affairs of the
South. In this,
he was helped by the Patwardhans,
Haripant Phadke, the Rastes and other
Sardars. As a result of this, Maratha
supremacy was established in the South.
The Holkars of Indore, Bhosales of
Nagpur, Shindes of Gwalior, Gaikwads of
Vadodara brought glory to the Maratha
power on the basis of their valour,
leadership qualities and capability. They
were the pillars of the Maratha power in
its last phase.
The Maratha Sardars were successful
in establishing the influence of the
Maratha power both in North and South
India. After the death of Mahadaji Shinde and Nana Phadanavis, the Maratha power
began to wane.
<br>
<br>
<br>
At that time, Bajirao II, the son of
Raghunathrao was the Peshwa. He did not
have leadership qualities and had many
vices. He was unable to unite the Maratha
Sardars. The internal strife between the
Sardars weakened their power.
During the reign of Bajirao II, the
Maratha influence in the North and South
waned further. The British replaced the
Marathas.
The British captured Pune in 1817 ce
and hoisted their flag ‘Union Jack’ there.
In 1818 ce the British defeated Marathas
in the battle of Ashti in Solapur district
and finally the Maratha power came to
an end. This event marks a major change
in the History of India. After this, the
British managed to gain control over a
major part of India. India came into
contact with the Western world. That led
to many changes in India’s social system.
Many old things became redundant or
were pushed aside. This was a major
transformation. A major change took
place. The medieval period of Indian
history came to an end. The Modern
period began.
