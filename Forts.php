            <p><b><h1>What Is A fort: </h1><hr>
            <h4>One comes across the maximum number of forts in the western parts of Maharashtra, especially in the Sahyadris. Looking at these, one cannot help but ponder over the purpose of constructing the forts on hills or mountain reefs. Probably, the forts presented a temporary place to inhabit during wars and to keep an eye on the enemy’s movements. Also, the natural or man made inaccessibility to these forts made them just rightly protected to dwell and to attack the enemy if time be. Thus, these forts can be looked upon as havens built to safeguard the dynasty and its mark on the pages of history.</h4>
            <h2>Types Of Forts:</h2><hr>
            <h4>It’s the construction site of the fort that decides its type. Though there are various categories of forts, three broad categories are widely popular.<br> 
            These are <b>GiriDurg</b> – the hill forts, <br>
            <b>JalDurg </b>- the sea fort; usually constructed on a sea shore or those constructed on the islands in the sea and BhuDurg- the forts built on flat lands.
Apart from these, there were 
<br>
<b>Vandurg </b>– the forest forts, <br>
<b>GavhraDurg</b> – the cave forts,<br>
 <b>KardamDurg </b>- the fort is built in a mud or a marshy land, as well as only fortress or fortified buildings are considered as the forts too.
Maharashtra has been ruled by people from outer states and countries and has considerable influence of their construction skills and styles in the making of these forts. One can identify involvement and designing and building skills of non-natives right from the Africans to the Europeans. Most of these forts have been built by the rulers of the Satavahana, Chalukya, Shilahar, Yadav, Kadamb, Bahmani, Mughal, Southern Monarchies, Maratha and Peshwa dynasty. Negros, Portuguese, Dutch and British from as old as two thousand years back have had their contribution in these constructions as well.
</h4>
<h2>Important Parts Of The fort:</h2><hr>
  <h4>The commonest of all - the hill fort is often seen to be divided into four parts. The Ghera, Met, Machi and Balekilla are the main parts of this fort. The ghera is said to be the village near the foothills of the fort, Met is the non-fortified freehold plateau kind of a land between the fort and machi. Machi is the fortified plain land inside the fort and finally the citadel at the pinnacle of the fort is the most protected place on the fort.

                                margin-right: auto;
                                width: 50%;
                          }
          </style>
          <br>



<h2>Other Places Found On The Fort :</h2><hr>
 
<h4>Every building or structure constructed on the fort holds a specific name for each construction. Some of the forts boast of “machi’s”, gates, walls and buildings constructed specifically. These constructions largely alter the importance of respective forts.
</h4>
<h2>Mahadarwaja:</h2><hr>
<h4>The main entrance on the Kingsway constructed to enter the fort is called Mahadarwaza. Some forts have specially designed bastions to protect the Mahadarwaja. Several others are also characterized by a number of doorways one after another in line for safety of the fort. On the inside of this Mahadarwaza, one can find a special cabin made for the guards called as the “devadi”.
</h4>
<h2>Nagarkhaana (The Drum House):</h2><hr>
<h4>The main entrance of the fort usually had a huge drum house. The opening and closing of the gates were normally accompanied by structured drum beats. On important occasions, a band of these drums often played to celebrate the event.
</h4>
<h2>Fortification:</h2><hr>
  <h4>The fort is often seen to be fortified with safety walls in the area between the “maachi” and the fortress or the citadel. These often had bastions built on them to double the safety.
  </h4>
<h2>Bastions :</h2><hr>
<h4>Bastions were constructed at a certain distance on the fortifications in various shapes. Some took the form of lotus petals while others were found to be semi-circular, triangular or hexagonal in shape. These bastions or towers had cannons mounted on them.
</h4>
<h2>Dhalkathi:</h2><hr>
<h4>Dhalkathi is a stacked structure designed on the bastion to hold the flag of the dynasty or the fort.
</h4>
<h2>Jangya (Embouchures):</h2><hr>
<h4>Specially designed cylindrical holes made in the walls or bastions to shoot guns and arrows from are called jangya(embouchures).
</h4> 
<h2>Charya(Merlons):</h2><hr>
<h4>Charya or the merlons are the specially carved or petal shaped stones kept on the bastions or the fortified walls. Soldiers could seek refuge behind these stones and open fire on the enemy when needed.
</h4>
<h2>Faanji:</h2><hr>
<h4>The patrolling lane along or on the fortified walls of the fort for the guards is known as faanji.
</h4>
<h2>Daaru Kothar (Ammunition Store):</h2><hr>
<h4>The storage room for ammunition and explosives is known is “daaru kothar”. It was often built away at safe distance from human colonies and habitations.
</h4> 
<h2>Chor Darwaza (Secret Door/Jib Door):</h2><hr>
<h4>Apart from the Mahadarwaza, every fort had other small doorways and some chor-darwaza or secret doors too. Most of the times these opened to difficult-to-climb pathways. Cleverly concealed in the fortified walls, these were often used for secret missions or undercover or confidential activities.
</h4>
<h2>Water Cisterns / Ponds / Wells:</h2><hr>
<h4>There were large tanks, ponds or wells for the purpose to have water stock on the fort. They were well taken care of as the water was an important and limited resource back then on hill tops.
</h4>
<h2>Palaces/Mansions/ Other Buildings:</h2><hr>
<h4>There were palaces, temples, buildings, etc. built for the important people living on the fort. Some forts have some distinctive buildings with special significance.
</h4> 
<h2>Shilekhana (Arsenal / Armoury):</h2><hr>
<h4>Shilekhana is the place for armours and weapons. Armourers and blacksmiths were diligently appointed to make , mend and sharpen the weapons.
</h4>
<h2>Kadelotachi Jaga (Punishment Point):</h2><hr>
<h4>Kadelot literally means pushing some off the cliff. It was the most common punishment in that era for treachery. Edge of the cliff or a big rock that protruded from the mountain was often chosen to be the punishment point or the kadelotachi jaga.

          <h4>One of the most popular trekking destinations near Pune, this fort is also rich with historical significance. This military fortification, built in the 17th century, is the birthplace of the founder of the Maratha Empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

The rock cut architecture of the forts, the Shivneri Caves and the presence of a water system indicate that Shivneri has been used since the 1st century. After being tossed between the Marathas and the Mughals, the fort was finally captured by the British army in 1820 following the Third Anglo- Maratha War.

This triangular shaped fort has a pond in the center of its complex called ‘Badami Talav’, as well as two water springs called Ganges and Yamuna which have water flow throughout the year. The nearby attractions from the Shivneri Fort include the Lenyadri Caves.

Located at an elevation of 1,403 meters above sea level, Torna Fort is the highest fort in the Pune district. This is one of the most serene forts in Maharashtra and turns into an extremely popular trekking haunt post monsoons.

A proper campsite has been created here due to the increase in the number of trekkers. As an alternative, one can even decide in the Menghai Temple inside the fort. During monsoons, the fort gets completely enveloped by clouds and it gets a little tricky to explore the fort properly due to poor visibility.</h4>

          <h4>Formerly known as Murudev, this hill fort is located in Pune District, and used to be the capital of the Maratha Empire for about 26 years under the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. This fort was built using the treasures discovered from the nearby Torna Fort, and boasts to have hosted Shivaji Maharaj for the highest number of days.

Resting 1,376 meters above sea level, the ruins of this fort include water cisterns, caves, and palaces. Built on a hill called Mumbadevi Dongar- meaning the mountain of the Goddess Murumba- Rajgad Fort has seen a number of historical events like the death of Shivaji’s queen Saibai, and the birth of his son Rajaram Chhatrapati.

This fort is also a popular monsoon trek destination, with visitors preferring to stay the night since the fort is too big to be explored in just a few hours. The temple of Padmavati at the top of the fort often serves as a lodging place for trekkers.</h4>

Overlooking the Parvana Reservoir, the four gates of the fort are still standing upright and are in good shape and it is one of the popular forts in Maharashtra.

This trek is especially famous during the monsoons and if one takes a small diversion, the majestic Bhaja Caves can also be visited on the way.

Within the limits of the fort are a few houses and temples dedicated to lords Maruti, Mahadeo, and Mahapurush. Entry to the fort during the monsoon is restricted because of the high tides that reach the top of the fort in the rainy season.Sindhudurg Fort is one of the main tourist places in Tarkarli. In the literal sense, the name Sindhudurg Fort means, fort built on the ocean floor. The fort was built by the famous Marathi king Shivaji, over a period of three years.

More than 100 Portuguese architects and thousands of Indian workers had built a fort to defend the Maratha Empire from the attacks of the outsiders or intruders. This historical site is one of the major places to visit in Tarkarli. </h4>
