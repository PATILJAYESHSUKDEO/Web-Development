<p><b><h1>Maratha Army</h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/Warriors/w5.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:22%;height:40%;">
<p><h4>Maratha (or Mahratta) Army refers to the land-based armed forces of the Maratha Empire, which existed from the late 17th to the early 19th centuries in India. The formation, rise, and decline of the armies of the Maratha Empire can be broadly divided into two eras
<br>
<br>
<b>17th century</b>
<br>
<br>
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Maratha empire, raised a small yet effective land army. For better administration, Shivaji abolished the land-grants or jagir for military officers and instituted a system of salary or cash payment for their services. During the 17th century the Maratha Army was small in terms of numbers when compared to the Mughals, numbering some 100,000. Shivaji gave more emphasis to infantry as against cavalry, considering the rugged mountainous terrain he operated in. Further, Shivaji did not have access to the North Indian Mughal dominated horse markets. During this era, the armies of the Marathas were known for their agility due to the light equipment of both infantry and cavalry. Artillery was mostly confined to the Maratha fortresses, which were located on hilltops, since it gave a strategic advantage and further these fortresses had abilities to withstand sieges (such as being equipped with sufficient water supply). The Marathas used weapons like muskets, matchlocks, firangi swords, clubs, bows, spears, daggers, etc. The cavalry rode the Bhimthadi horse, which was developed by crossing Arabian and local horse breeds.


<br><br>

The Maratha Army, during Shivaji's era was systematic and disciplined. A case in point here is that the Marathas achieved success in systematic elimination of all forts which came their way during the Battle of Surat circa 1664. When it came to the artillery, Shivaji hired foreign (mainly Portuguese) mercenaries for assistance to manufacture weapons. The hiring of foreign mercenaries was not new to the Maratha military culture. Shivaji hired seasoned cannon-casting Portuguese technicians from Goa. The Marathas attached importance to hiring of experts, which can be corroborated by the fact that important posts in the army were offered to the officers in charge of the manufacture of guns.

The Army deployed musketeers as well - both regular and mercenaries. During the late 17th century, there is a mention of the Marathas using well-armed musketeers during their attack on Goa (during the reign of Sambhaji). Further, during the same period there is also a mention of Marathas using Karnataki musketeers renowned for marksmanship

<p><b><h1>Structure and Rank</h1></b><hr>

<br>
<p><h4>Below was the structure and ranks of armies of the great Maratha at a high level during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji: Cavalry was divided into two at a high level:
<br>
<b>Shiledar:</b> A shiledar brought his own horse and equipment. Although organized different, even shiledar converged into the Sarnobat (chief of Army) <br>
<br><b>Bargir:</b> One of the lowest rank (rank and file) cavalryman of the Marathas who was provided with horse and equipment from the State's stock<br>
<br><br>The infantry consisted of the below:

<br><b>Hetkari musketeers: </b>Konkani musketeers recruited typically from the Konkan region, who possessed matchlocks and noted for their marksmanship
<b>Mavales: </b>Foot soldier recruited typically from western Maharashtra

Ranks and salary of the cavalry are as below. The infantry had a similar structure
<br><br>
<b>Sarnobat (chief of Army)(a part of the Council of Eight): 4000 to 5000 hons per year</b><br>
<b>Panch Hazari: 2000 hons per year</b><br>
<b>Hazari: 1000 hons per year</b><br>
<b>Jumledar: 500 hons per year</b><br>
<b>Havaldar: 125 hons per year</b><br>
<b>Bargir: 9 hons per year</b><br><br><br>
<b>Infantry ranks (starting with senior-most rank):</b><br>

<b>Sarnobat (chief of Army)</b><br>
<b>Saat (Seven) Hazari</b><br>
<b>Hazari</b><br>
<b>Jamdar</b><br>
<b>Havaldar</b><br>
<b>Nayak (or Naik)</b><br>

<p><b><h1>During the War of 27 Years</h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/Wars/w7.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:25%;height:60%;">
<br>
<p><h4>During the War of 27 Years (1680 to 1707) the Maratha State forces (regular army) dispersed and the theater of warfare became entire Southern India (or Deccan India). During this period the armies of the Marathas resorted to guerrilla warfare; bands of irregular soldiers also joined in and it became a People's War. Raiding enemy's rear, isolated posts, supply lines was a feature during this period. Common men and women from virtually every town and village offered shelter to the Mahratta forces led by two valiant Generals - Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav

Jadunath Sarkar the noted historian writes in his famous book namely military history of India about Santaji Ghorpade, a brilliant strategist who fought the Mughals in the 27 year war :

"He was a perfect master of this art, which can be more correctly described as Parthian warfare than as guerrilla tactics, because he could not only make night marches and surprises, but also cover long distances quickly and combine the movements of large bodied over wide areas with an accuracy and punctuality which were incredible in any Asiatic army other than those of Chengiz Khan and Tamurlane".

<p><b><h1>18th century</h1></b><hr>
<img src="images/Wars/w8.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:25%;height:60%;">
<br>
<p><h4><b>Pre-1761</b><br>
<br>
During the 18th century the Maratha army continued its emphasis on its light cavalry, which proved better against the heavy cavalry of the Mughals. Post 1720, the armies of the Maratha Empire, in the reign of Chhatrapati Shahu started making their presence felt in Northern India (the bastion of the Mughals) and scored numerous military victories, primarily due to the skills of his Peshwa Bajirao I as a great cavalry leader and military strategist. Bajirao Peshwa made excellent use of small and heavy ammunition (using it in excellent coordination) and used smothering tactics. The Marathas led by Bajirao I would use their artillery to create a blanket of projectiles to smother the enemy.

A hallmark of Peshwa Baji Rao I's contingents was that of long-distance cavalry attacks, typically light and agile cavalry. During the reign of Chhatrapati Shahu, the cavalry strength was some 100,000. Chhatrapati's own cavalry was called as the Huzurat Cavalry which was an elite cavalry division led by the Peshwa. Further, Baji Rao used massed ranks of infantry consisting of flintlock-armed regulars under South Asian officers.
<br><br><b>Modernization pre-1761</b>
<br>
<br>
When the Marathas confronted the French (allies of the Nizam) on battlefield in 1750s, they realized the importance of western-style disciplined infantry. Hence the process of modernization began even before the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). Sadashivrao Bhau admired Western-style disciplined infantry.Circa 1750s, the Marathas endeavored to hire the services of the French General Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau (who served in the Nizam’s Army) for training purposes, but when they failed in their efforts, they managed to hire Ibrahim Khan Gardi. Ibrahim Khan was an artillery expert trained under the leadership of Bussy. The word gardi is a corruption of the French word garde (guard) and this gardi formed the backbone of Maratha infantry. Ibrahim Khan played a major role in re-configuring the Maratha artillery. He served the Marathas in the infamous Third Battle of Panipat. During the battle, out of the approximate 40,000 Maratha Army men, some 8000 or 9000 were artillery (Gardi Infantry). They possessed 200 cannons (consisting of heavy field-pieces as well as light camel or elephant-mounted zambaruks (a swivel gun equivalent) and also possessed handguns.

During this era, sources state that the Marathas made use of both flintlocks and matchlocks and that their matchlocks had a technological advantage having superior range and velocity.However at Third Battle of Panipat, they possessed mainly just swords and spears whilst Abdali possessed a larger force with flintlock muskets.
<br><br><b>Modernization post-1761</b><br><br>From the 17th century till the mid-18th century the artillery of the Marathas was more dependent on foreign gunners rather than their own.

Post 1761 Mahadaji Shinde, a distinguished Maratha Maharaja, focused his attention on European artillery and secured the services of the noted Frenchman Benoît de Boigne who had received training from the best of the European military schools. Following suit, the other Maratha chiefs such as the Peshwas, the Holkars, the Bhosales, also raised French-trained artillery battalions.

<br><br><b>Chhatrapati's Cavalry: The elite Huzurat cavalry were equipped with matchlocks instead of long spears.</b><br>
<br><b>Scindia's infantry organization and weapons under De Boigne: De Boigne organized his infantry under campoos. One campoo had 10 infantry battalions, which consisted of 4000 infantrymen equipped with flintlocks and bayonets. Each battalion had 5 guns (1 howitzer and 4 field guns) and every battalion was commanded by a European gunner. Each campoo had 30 siege guns (16 and 24 pounder guns), apart from mortar guns, howitzers, and camel-mounted blunderbusses. Five campoos were raised between 1790 and 1803. The artillery had 50 bronze cannons (half of which were big caliber guns).</b><br>
<br><b>Training: Further there was emphasis on training and infantrymen were trained on handling firearms, gunnery practice, and military manoeuvres.</b><br>
<br><b>Innovations: Under De Boigne a new weapon was invented having six musket barrels joined together.</b> <br>
<br><b>Ambulance Corps: Another novelty was the ambulance corps in charge of providing aid to wounded soldiers (including enemy soldiers) </b><br>
<br><b>Composition: Under Mahadji Scindia, Rajput and Muslim infantrymen were recruited in the Maratha Army. Further, his cavalrymen had a different uniform - long trousers as opposed to the shorter Deccani ones</b><br>
<br><b>Military-Industrial Complex: Further circa 1784, Mahadaji Shinde established a military-industrial complex for the armies of the Maratha near Agra. The ordnance factories of the Marathas made use of sophisticated indigenous technologies with more of adaptation as against innovation. Mahadaji Shinde created one of finest armies in India, with the help of the French and Portuguese and it also included a brigade known as Deccan Invincibles, which numbered some 27,000.</b><br>
<br>There is a mention of induction of 6 pound field guns under the command of Pierre Perron, Maratha General of Scindia dominions (the successor of De Boigne). These 6 pound guns were inducted after phasing out the earlier light 3 pound ones.
In a bid to Westernize the artillery, circa 1777, there is a mention of a Portuguese officer named Naronha heading the Peshwa’s artillery and further he had a number of European artillery men working under him. Circa 1790, the Peshwa's forces employed a Portuguese officer for casting 40-pounder guns.
The Nagpur Senasahebsubah Bhonsle's forces had two Westernized infantry brigades, however without any European officers, while Scindia's forces were the most Westernized.
<br><br>
The arms of the Marathas
However a point to be noted here is that it is untrue to conclude that armies of the Maratha got disciplined only post 1761. The Marathas were well aware of the importance of discipline and disciplined and drilled infantry in Maharashtra existed even in the Hindu classical era. The Mahrattas were aware of the Portuguese infantry models having concepts like "Spanish square" since sixteenth century.

In the late 18th century and early 19th century, with French-trained artillery and infantry, the Marathas managed to regain their lost ground in North India, however they could not match the superior artillery of the British East India Company, which in due course of time, among other reasons, led to the defeat of the Marathas at the Third Anglo-Maratha War and decline of their Empire itself.
<br><br><b>Employment of the Pindaris</b><br><br>
Pindaris were irregular horsemen and their primary role was to plunder in return of payment. Pindaris composed of both Muslims and Hindus. They had implicit support from Maratha chiefs (Maharajas) such as Scindias of Gwalior, Holkars of Indore, and Bhosales of Nagpur. This band of freebooters accompanied Maratha forces during their campaigns and helped win wars in return for plunder and pay. They were a part of the Maratha Army during the Third Battle of Panipat and almost all Anglo-Maratha Wars.
  <br><br><b>Employment of Bargis</b><br><br>
The Nagpur Bhosales employed thousands of units called Bargi to invade Mughal Bengal. The invasions lasted annually for ten years until finally the Nawab of Bengal, European merchants and locals had built the Maratha Ditch to safeguard themselves from war.
The Bargi were involved in several war crimes.
<br><br><b>Possible employment of Gurkha</b><br><br>
The Peshwa was very successful in deploying forces in Northern India. There are indications that India's native Gurkha may have sided with the Maratha during their attacks upon Delhi, the seat of Mughal rule.

      <br>
      <p><h4>Tanaji Malusare (Marathi language: तानाजी मालुसरे), also known as Simha ("lion"), was a warrior and military leader in the army of Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire in 17th century India. Tanaji was one of Shivaji's closest friends hailing from the Malusare clan; the two had known each other since childhood. Tanaji is famously known for the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670. <br><br>At Shivaji's request, he pledged to recapture the fortress of Kondana near Pune. According to many accounts, he received the summons while at his son's wedding, and immediately left the festivities.He said,"aadhi lagin kondhanyacha". Tanaji and his troops scaled the fort with the help of domesticated mountain lizards (ghorpad in Marathi), to whom they tied ropes and sent crawling up to the top of the ramparts. (The ghorpad, or the Common Indian Monitor,grows up to 1.8m in length, and its natural habitat is rocky terrain, which it scales by gripping crevices with its strong claws: it is also hunted in villages as food.).
       Tanaji's pet ghorpad tried twice to scale the ramparts but failed. finally Tanaji told the ghorpad that if it failed once more, he would kill and eat it. The ghorpad successfully climbed the ramparts. Tanaji and his men than climbed the fort in pitch darkness. He and his men recaptured the fort from Udaybhan Rathod, fortkeeper of Jai Singh I. A fierce combat took place between Tanaji and Udaybhan.
      <br><br> Udaybhan managed to rid Tanaji of his shield, but Tanaji fought on by tying a cloth over one of his hands and using it to ward off Uday Bhan's sword attacks. Despite a lengthy fight, Tanaji was killed in battle, and Shivaji renamed the fort from Kondana to Sinhagad in his honor. Per legend, Shivaji's words after hearing about the demise of Tanaji were Gad ala pan Sinha gela("although the fort was captured a lion was lost").<b>Battle of Delhi, 1803</b><br><br>

      Hambirrao Mohite was the chief military commander of Shivaji Maharaj army. An able military general, he executed several campaigns for Shivaji Raje and later served under Sambhaji Maharaj.
      Hambirrao was born in Talbid 1630.[1][unreliable source?] Sambhaji Mohite had 3 sons Harifrao, Hambirrao, Shankarji and 2 daughters Soyarabai and Annubai. Hambirrao's father Sambhaji Mohite was a very mighty and courageous chief. Hambirrao inherited all the qualities from his father.

In Yelburga, on January 1677, both the armies collided. Hambirrao and Dhanaji Jadhav showed incomparable valor in this battle. More than half of Adilshah's army was killed in this battle. Hambirrao killed Abdul Miyana and imprisoned Hussain Miyana.

        <br> <br><b>Battle between Hambir Rao and Venkoji</b><br> <br>
        Hambirrao had two sisters, Soyarabai, who married Shivaji Maharaj and Annubai, who married Venkoji (step-brother of Shivaji Maharaj). Sometime later, Shivaji Raje came to Karnataka to the Dakshin Digvijay (South conquest). When Venkoji (Ekoji) refused to share his father's property with Shivaji Maharaj, war started between them. Hambirrao won major provinces of Venkoji such as Jagdevagad, Kaveripattam, Chidambaram, and Vriddhachalam. Venkoji was very upset that Shivaji Maharaj captured his states. On 6 November 1677, the battle started in Venkoji and Hambirrao. Venkoji seemed to win in battle, but later Hambirrao suddenly attacked Venkoji's army and won the defeated battle. After two months Shivaji Raje's intervention ended the fight.

Hambirrao won the important fort of Vellore on 22 July 1678 from Adilshahi general Abdullakhan.
        <br> <br><b>Role of Hambirrao in coronation of Sambhaji Maharaj</b><br> <br>
        Shivaji Maharaj died on 3 April 1680. On 21 April, the corrupt ministers of Swarajya crowned Rajaram Maharaj. At that time Rajaram Maharaj was only ten years old. Rajaram Maharaj was the nephew of Hambirrao. The ministers of Swarajya ordered Sambhaji Maharaj to be imprisoned. When Hambirrao came to know about this, Hambirrao captured all the ministers and presented them to Sambhaji Maharaj.

This shows how deep Hambirao's undying loyalty to Swarajya was.
        <br> <br><b>Attack on Burhanpur</b><br> <br>
        Burhanpur was a major trade center connecting southern and northern India. There were a total of 17 trade centers in Burhanpur. On 30 January 1681, commanders Hambirrao Mohite and Sambhaji Maharaj suddenly attacked Burhanpur. At that time the Subedar of Burhanpur was Khanjahan. For the protection of Burhanpur there was only an army of 200 and Hambirrao had an army of 20,000. The Mughals did not even have the strength to oppose Hambir Rao's army. The Marathas looted all the trade centers of Burhanpur for three days. Marathas got assets worth more than 1 crore hons in this battle.
        <br>
On 17 March 1683, Hambirrao defeated Ranamast khan, one of the most powerful chieftains of Aurangzeb, in Kalyan Bhiwandi.

In 1687, in a battle fought near Wai province, Hambirrao defeated With a heavy defeat of Rustumkhan, but a cannonball hit Sarsenapati HambirRao Mohite having a acedental death'

      <img src="images/Warriors/MD.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:22%;height:50%;">
      <br>
      <p><h4>Murarbaji Deshpande (17th century) was a general in the early Maratha Empire during the reign of Shivaji. He is best remembered for his defense of the Purandar Fort against Dilir Khan, a Mughal general who accompanied Mirza Raja Jai Singh in the 17th-century siege on Purandar.</b><br><br>
      Murarbaji Deshpande was born into a Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family and his native land was the Kinjaloli near Mahad, Raigad District. He was the gallant commander who commanded 700 mavle (maratha troop) to attack Diler Khan.
       
    The battle for Purandar fort was a landmark battle of symbolic importance for both the Marathas and Mughals. It was essential for the Marathas to hold off the Mughals for as long as possible, thus demonstrating the difficulty of conquering the mountainous Maratha Empire. It was equally imperative for the Mughals to conquer Purandar as swiftly as possible to demonstrate the futility of resistance of the dominant Mughal empire.
        <br> 
In the end, superior European cannons fielded by the Mughals, under the leadership of the European mercenary Mannucci, blasted away the walls of Purandar. In spite of crumbling defenses, Murarbaji and his troops sustained a dogged defense. When the Mughals breached the outer walls, Murarbaji and his soldiers, though overwhelmingly outnumbered, mounted a fierce counterattack. Maratha folk history has it that Murarbaji showed incredible skills as a swordsman and was an aggressive and inspiring leader who pushed back and caused a retreat of a larger Mughal force.
<br> 
Diler Khan, impressed with the bravery of Murarbaji, offered him a truce and employment in the Mughal forces with a handsome salary. Murarbaji turned down the offer due to his loyalty to the ideals of Hindavi Swarajya. He was extremely enraged at this very suggestion and in an act of extreme daredevilry charged with his commandos right into the heart of the Mughal troops, killing hundreds. The remaining Marathas retreated inside the inner walls (baalekilla) of the fort, refusing to surrender and willing to fight to the last man.    <br> 
<br> The battle of Purandar showed the Marathas the difficulty in facing the overwhelming force led by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, and revealed to the Mughal the tenacity of the Marathas. Thereafter Shivaji agreed to surrender to Mirza Raja rather than risk the decimation of his forces and the ruin of his homeland. Aurangzeb sought to sign the treaty of Purandar and invited Shivaji to Agra rather than face a protracted and expensive campaign to conquer Marathas. As a part of the settlement Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his forts and 4,00,000 hons to the Mughals. He also agreed to let his son Sambhaji become a Mughal Sardar and serve the Mughal court of Aurangzeb.

     <br><p><b><h1>Santaji Ghorpade</h1></b><hr>
      <img src="images/Warriors/SG.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:22%;height:15%;">
      <br>
      <p><h4>Santaji Mahaloji Ghorpade,(1645–1696)[citation needed] popularly known as ‘Santaji’ or ‘Santaji Ghorpade’, was one of the greatest warriors and the chief General of the Maratha Empire during Rajaram’s regime. His name became inseparable from the name of Dhanaji Jadhav with whom he made campaigns against Mughal Army continuously from 1689 to 1696. He is considered to be one of the most foremost exponents of ganimi kava (Guerilla warfare).</b><br><br>
       
      Santaji belonged to the historical Ghorpade family which is a branch of the Sisodia-Bhosale clan. Ghorpades were originally called Bhosales because of their ancestor Bhosaji sisodia of chittor. His year of birth is not known, however, it is estimated to be circa 1660. He was the eldest of three sons of[citation needed] of Mhaloji Ghorpade, who was the Senapati (General) of Sambhaji Maharaj. He had two younger brothers named Bahirji and Maloji. Mhaloji was the son of Baji Ghorpade, who was killed by Shivaji, as some sources say Baji contrived along with Afzal Khan in imprisoning and humiliating Shahji raje Bhosale (Shivaji's father) in Adilshah court. Later, however, Shivaji made peace with Mhaloji Ghorpade by providing his wise reasons for killing Baji Ghorpade. Santaji rose through the ranks under the guidance of. Hambirrao Mohite. Santaji and his younger brother Bahirji accompanied Shivaji in his campaign of Jalna in 1679. Shivaji had punished a young Santaji asking him not to show his face for three months when he ignored the retreat warning at Jalna thus causing delay to Maratha forces. Santaji later on became an important Sardar during Sambhaji Maharaj's reign. Sambhaji Maharaj had sent him and senior Sardar Keso Trimal Pingle with an army of 17,000 to bring food supplies from the Gingee region in 1686. Santaji was with his father in 1689 when Sambhaji Maharaj was being captured, while Mhaloji refused to leave Sambhaji Maharaj being his Senapati and died protecting his king in Sangameshwar. Santaji was asked to leave ahead as Sambhaji Maharaj planned to distract invading Mogul forces and escape.[citation needed]. After his untimely and unceremonious death, his sons and brothers remained loyal to Rajaram and Tarabai[citation needed] further helping the Maratha cause of Swaraj.
        <br> <br><b>Role in Maratha-Mughal War</b><br> <br>
        In the beginning of the Rajaram's regime in 1689, Santaji had attained the rank of Pancha Hajari officer i.e. commander of 5,000 soldiers. Immediately after Sambhaji's brutal torture and execution by Aurangzeb, Santaji attacked his camp at Tulapur with the help of his brothers, Bahirji Ghorpade and Maloji Ghorpade, nephew Vithoji Chavan and 2000 soldiers from Dhanaji's troops. In a daring feat, he cut the ropes of Aurangzeb's tents and took the imperial golden pinnacles and fled. Many were killed in Aurangzeb's royal tent. Initially, it was assumed Aurangzeb died too, however, he was found alive later as he was spending time in Zenat-Un-Nissa's, Auranzeb's daughter, tent. However, this incidence helped to boost the Maratha morale and restored their self-confidence to resist and attack the Mughal occupation of Maharashtra. Rajaram I conferred titles to the three Ghorpades and Vithoji Chavan for this brave attack; Santaji was given title of Mamalakatt Madaar, Bahirji was given title as Hindurao and younger brother Maloji as Ameer-ul-Umrao and Vithoji Chavan was given title as Himmat Bahadur.

        <br><br>In September 1689 along with Dhanaji, Santaji attacked Aurangzeb's General Shiekh Nizam who had placed a siege around the fort of Panhala. Nizam's army was severely beaten and his treasure, horses and elephants were captured. Then during 1689–1690 period, Santaji and Dhanaji were directed to prevent Mughal army in Maharashtra from chasing and entering Karnataka after Rajaram's flight to Jinjee. They succeeded in this task and were able to slow down and engage the Mughals in harassing skirmishes. In December 1690, Santaji and Dhanaji were promoted as leading Maratha generals, and were placed respectively under the supervision of Ramchandra Pant Amatya and Shankraji Narayan Sacheev.

        <br><br>On 25 May 1690, Sarzakhan alias Rustamkhan, a Mughal nobleman and commander, was soundly defeated and captured near Satara jointly by Ramchandra Pant Amatya, Shankraji Narayan, Santaji and Dhanaji and this proved to be a major setback to emperor Aurangzeb. In July 1692, for his great victory, Rajaram rewarded him with the Deshmukhi (fiefdom) of Miraj.

In the last quarter of 1692, Santaji and Dhanaji were sent south to alleviate the Mughal pressure on Jinjee. And on the way there they managed to capture Dharwad on 8 October 1692, Dharwad with an army consisting of 7000 Maratha foot soldiers under the duo's command.

<br><br>On 14 December 1692, Santaji defeated Aurangzeb's General Alimardan Khan, captured him and brought him back to fort Jinjee. In December 1692, the Mughal army under Zulfikhar Ali Khan around fort Jinjee was blocked and beaten by Santaji and Dhanaji as a result of which Zulfiquar khan had to sue King Rajaram for peace and was forced to compromise. Then on 5 January 1693, Santaji attacked the Mughal camp at Desur and looted their treasure, weapons and livestock.

<br><br>On 14 November 1693, Mughal General Himmat Khan beat back Santaji near Vikramhalli in Karnataka. Soon thereafter, Santaji regrouped his troops and reengaged Himmat Khan again on 21 November 1693 and avenged his earlier defeat.

<br><br>In July 1695, Santaji trapped the Mughal army camping near Khatav and harassed it with Blitzkrieg.[citation needed] Italian visitor to the Mughal court, Minnucci, has listed details of the lightning-fast and devastating Maratha attacks on the Mughal camps. High level of tension, stress and apprehension among the troops and camp followers, about the ever-present Maratha threat were recorded. On 20 November 1695, Kasim Khan, Aurangzeb's powerful General in Karnataka, was attacked, defeated and killed by Santaji at Doderi near Chitradurga.

<br><br>In December 1695, Dhanaji was defeated in a battle near Vellore by Zulfiquar Khan. On 20 January 1696 near Baswapattan, Santaji attacked, defeated and personally killed the Mughal General Himmat Khan. On 26 February 1696, Mughal General Hamid-uddin Khan defeated Santaji in a brief tussle. In April 1696, Santaji was also defeated by Zulfikhar Khan at Arani in Karnataka.

<br><br>In 1693, after lengthy negotiations with Rajaram, Zulfiquar Khan was granted a safe passage out which Santaji did not approve. Santaji had bravely defeated and captured Zuliquar Khan. It is a widely known fact that Zulfiquar Khan deliberately delayed the capture of Jingee going along with his father Asad Khan's plan to carve a territory for himself, similar to, now defunct, Adilshah and Qutubshah states in the South. They hoped and expected octogenarian Aurangzeb would die soon either due to old age or overthrown by his impatient sons for the Delhi throne. Thus, the succession chaos at the Mogul court will ensue to provide them with the opportunity to annex the southern territory, especially Golconda in Hyderabad.

<br><br>Rajaram was aware of Zulfiquar's ambitions and colluded with the Khan against Aurangzeb, probably for the sake of politics, survival and safety of future. Later in 1699, Zulfiquar also provided safe passage to Rajaram's wives unmolested when he captured Jinjee, with Rajaram already escaped. The Khan and Rajaram had understanding to benefit each other for politics or previous gratitudes. This was similar to Shahji and Radullah, later by their sons, Shivaji and Rustam, providing each other with intel of their courts. The politics then was very complex and everchanging, those acted without personal vendettas survived and were clear in their foresightedness. Zulfiquar Khan also escorted Sambhaji's family respectfully and unmolested to Aurangzeb after he captured Raigad. He also was very protective and great well wisher of Shahu's (Sambhaji's son in captivity) in Aurangzeb's campaign, probably hoped for the Maratha help for his own ambitions. Zulfiquar's mother was Shaista Khan's sister and he himself married to the Khan's daughter. Shaista Khan, who was also married to Aurangzeb's sister, lost his three fingers and pride at the hands of Shivaji, Rajaram's father, in the most famous surprise attack in Pune.

Santaji as much known to be great and intrepid in guerrilla warfare tactics did not seem shrewd in understanding the manipulation of politics and diplomacy behind curtains, and misunderstood his King and the final Maratha cause on many occasions leading to rift between him and Rajaram.

<br><br>On 8 May 1696, Santaji met Rajaram at fort Jinjee, argued with him on certain issues, some sources suggest he demanded rewards for his services, and left Jingee without resolving their differences. Santaji didn't exactly had a suave tongue like Dhanaji Jadhav and dealt much action with confrontation, bravado and brutal rage, but was highly disciplined and loyal to the Maratha cause, to overpower and subdue his opponents decisively. While meeting Rajaram, he argued and very disrespectfully said, "The Chatrapatti exist because of me and I can make and dethrone Chatrapattis at will". He probably reliased later in the fit of anger he has sealed his fate and left the place without Rajaram's permission. Dhanaji was made the new Sarnaubat(Master of Cavalry), which further enraged Santaji.

Rajaram, then did not have wise counsel of Praladji Pant, his Pratinidi (top minister), who had died. Praladji proved great talent in previously handling conflicting personalities like Santaji during the start of Maratha resurrection after Sambhaji's death. Rajaram, therefore, couldn't deal such a disrespectful provocation without reprimand in order to maintain discipline in Maratha ranks. Even though these were unpardonable provocations during Rajaram's predecessor's time or even according to Santaji's own military standards. The arrest orders were issued by the King to discipline the great warrior to avoid further mischief, but Rajaram would not have wanted him assassinated as some popular sources later suggest wrongly. Santaji was already chased by his enemies in both camps, Marathas and Moguls.

<br><br>In June 1696, by order of Rajaram, Dhanaji attacked Santaji for his rebellion near Vriddhachalam but had to turn back. In March 1697, Dhanaji defeated Santaji at Dahigaon with the help of Hanmantrao Nimbalkar.

Jadunath Sarkar, a renowned historian on Maratha history, provides a great insight in his book, House of Shivaji, about the heroics and fall of Santaji Ghorpade. Khafi Khan writes,"Shanta used to inflict severe punishments on his followers. For the slightest fault he would cause the offender to be trampled to death under an elephant." The man who insists on efficiency and discipline in a trophical country makes himself universally unpopular, and, therefore, we are not surprised when we learn from Khafi Khan that " Most of Maratha Nobles became Shanta's enemies and made a secret agreement with his rival Dhanaji Jadhav to destroy him."

<br><br>In May 1696, Dhanaji attacked Santaji but Santaji was victorious and was able to capture one of Dhanaji's key member, Amritrao Nimbalkar. Santaji later trampled him to death under an elephant. Amritrao's sister, Radhabai, was married to Nagoji Mane of Mhaswad, who then worked for Moguls. The loving sister demanded her husband to avenge the death of her brother.

In Masir-i-Alamgiri, Aurangzeb's biography, depicts an account of Santaji, "On the way to Jingee, this wretch had a fight with Dhana Jadhav, who was escorting Rajaram there, on account of an old quarrel. Shanta triumphed, and caused Amritrao, the brother-in-law of Nagoji, comrade and assistant of Dhana, to be crushed under an elephant. He also captured Rajaram but Dhana escaped. The next day Shanta appeared before Rajaram with his wrists bound together, pleading," I am the same loyal servant(as before). My rudeness was due to this that you wanted to make Dhana my equal and reach Jingi with his help. I shall now do whatever you bid me." Then he released Rajaram and conducted Rajaram to Jinjee.

Another cause of Satanji's attitude of aloofness from the government was his being drawn into the cross-currents of ministerial rivalry of the western capital of Maharashtra. He sided with Parshuram the rival of Ramchandra Pant, otherwise known as Amatya. Dhana Jadhav was preferred by Rajaram and Ramchandra Pant, latter was more of regeant to Rajaram and conducted all his affairs in Maratha resurrection after the death of Sambhaji. Dhana was also well praised in Mogul records and preferred in any negotiations arose between Marathas and Mogul Chieftains. Dhana was the great-grandson of Jijabai's brother. Jijabai was also the grandmother of Rajaram. Santaji was possibly the grandson of Baji Ghorpade, who arrested and humiliated the grandfather of Rajaram, Shahji in Adilshah court in 1648. This, however, unlikely had any bearing on the strained relations between two factions. Shahji Raje helped many of his Maratha relatives rise to power, and Ghorpades also benefitted greatly from his benevolence.

Either Santaji felt under-appreciated and expected more rewards, or others felt his means and methods brutal and distasteful, he certainly could have been managed well if Rajaram had a good counsel of ministers to handle such personalities through diplomacy. Then, there were known devious means by Moguls as well to create rift within Marathas using individual factions' insecurities. In all likelihood Santaji, much like his previous King Sambhaji, took pride in his bravery and was loyal to Maratha cause of Swaraj to be seduced by any of enemy bribes or tactics.

<br><br>In July 1697, Maratha Sardar Nagoji Mane killed Santaji in the forest of Karkhel while Santaji was performing religious rites on banks of a local river to avenge death of his sisters husband . The head was paraded with big pomp and trumpets by Mogul soldiers, most likely to reduce fear than celebrate the demise of most dreaded enemy. Thus, weakening Maratha cause for some time after Santaji's death.

The Marathas from time to time lost such great heroes and lost the momentum of much-revered Swaraj. However, his compatriot, Dhanaji Jadhav didn't forget him. Till his death in 1708, he continued campaigns in his name. Together, they had done a lot, now without Santaji, things were harder, but hope wasn't lost.
        <br> <br><b>Legacy</b><br> <br>
        His eldest son Ranoji became a successful general and he died in a battle in 1701. Santaji's son Yeshoji & Tukoji continued his military activities by shifting their base to Sandur near Bellary & Guti in Karnataka.With help of Telangi-Berads, they sided with Tarabai faction of Kolhapur during Maratha war of succession fought between Shahu & Tarabai. After the Peshwa of Pune obtained additional powers in 1749, Ghorpades concentrated their activities in Karnataka.

Murarrao Ghorpade, a grandnephew of Santaji, made an alliance with Muhammad Ali and helped him to defeat Chanda Sahib in famous Battle of Arcot fought in 1751. This battle is known in history of British East India Company as part of the Carnatic Wars fought between Robert Clive led forces of British East India Company and Dupleix led French East India Company between 1751 and 1758, also known as 7 years war. English historians tend to highlight & threat from Nizam of Hyderabad-Hyder Ali-Tipu Sultan kept them engrossed in Karnataka-Tamil Nadu away from politics of Pune Darbars.    <br>Ghorpades maintained working relationship with British East India Company in their Karnataka-Tamil Nadu operations maturing from the cordial relationship established with Robert Clive during siege of Arcot in 1751. Descendants of Santaji still live in Sandur & Guti, Karnataka. His descendants are also part of the families of Bedag Thane, Madhabhavi Thane, Khemlapur Thane, of state Datwadd, Satave in Kolhapur and Sangli districts of Maharashtra. One branch of descendants continued to serve under Kolhapur Princely State of Bhosale. Ramchandra Ghorpade of this branch held feudal estate near Satave of Panhala. Later after independence of India his grandson Nivruti Vithoji Ghorpade co-founded Warana Sugar and allied industries. He remained vice-chairman of Warana industries for 35 years.

<br>      <br>Jadunath Sarkar the noted historian writes in his famous book namely military history of India about Santaji:

He was a perfect master of this art, which can be more correctly described as Parthian warfare than as guerrilla tactics, because he could not only make night marches and surprises, but also cover long distances quickly and combine the movements of large bodieds over wide areas with an accuracy and punctuality which were incredible in any Asiatic army other than those of Chengiz Khan and Tamurlane. Santaji had an inborn genius of handling large bodies of troops spread through long distances changing his tactics so as to take prompt advantage of every change in enemy's plans and conditions, and organising combined movement without the risk of failure.[

      <img src="images/Warriors/BD.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:20%;height:40%;">
      <br>
      <p><h4>Baji Prabhu Deshpande (c. 1615-1660) was a commander of Maratha king Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha empire. The legend of Baji Prabhu is linked with an important rear guard battle enabling Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's escape from Panhala fort; he was the hero who sacrificed his life for his king.</b><br><br>
       
      <br> Baji Prabhu was 15 years older than Shivaji, which indicates he was born around 1615. He was born in a Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family.He was working under Krishnaji bandal of rohida near Bhor.Shivaji defeats krishnaji at rohida and captures the fort and many commanders along with Bajiprabhu joins the swarajya.
        <br> <br><b>Battle of Pavan Khind</b><br> <br>
        After defeating Afzal Khan and the rout of the Bijapuri army at Pratapgad, Shivaji continued to push deep into Bijapuri territory. Within a few days, the Marathas captured Panhala fort (near the city of Kolhapur). Meanwhile, another Maratha force, led by Netaji Palkar, pushed straight on towards Bijapur. Bijapur repulsed this attack, forcing Shivaji, some of his commanders and soldiers to retreat to Panhala fort.

The Bijapuri force was led by Siddhi Johar, an Abyssinian general. Discovering Shivaji's location, Johar laid siege to Panhala. Netaji Palkar made repeated attempts to break the Bijapuri siege from outside, but these failed.

Finally, a very audacious and high-risk plan was hatched and put into action: Shivaji, Baji Prabhu Deshpande with a select band of troops would attempt to break through the siege at the night, and make for Vishalgad. In order to deceive the Bijapuri forces, who would give a chase once they found that Shivaji had broken the siege, Shiva Nhavi, who had an uncanny physical resemblance to Shivaji, volunteered to dress like the king and let himself be captured.

On a stormy full moon's night (night of Guru Pournima, Ashadh Paurnima) a band of 600 select men, led by Baji Prabhu and Shivaji, broke through the siege. They were hotly pursued by the Bijapuri force. As planned, Shiva Nhavi allowed himself to be captured and taken back to the Bijapuri camp, fully comprehending that he would be put to death once the charade was discovered. This sacrifice, however, gave the fleeing Maratha force some breathing space.

As soon as the Bijapuri force realized their mistake, the chase was on again, led by Siddhi Masood, the son-in-law of Siddhi Johar. Near the pass of Ghodkhind (Horse's Pass), the Marathas made a final stand. Shivaji and half of the Maratha force pushed for Vishalgadh, while Baji Prabhu, his brother Phulaji and the remaining Bandal Sena of about 300 men blocked the pass and fought against 10000 Bijapuri soldiers in the Ghodkhind Pass for more than 18 hours.

Tradition and legend describe feats of valour displayed by the Marathas during this rear-guard action. Baji Prabhu had mastered the art of using a weapon called "Dand Patta". Through the entire battle, Baji Prabhu, even though grievously injured, continued fighting, inspiring his men to fight on until Shivaji's safe journey to Vishalgadh was signaled by the firing of three cannon volleys. It should be mentioned that when Shivaji approached Vishalgad with 300 men, the fort was already under siege by Bijapuri sardars named Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi. Shivaji with his 300 men had to defeat Surve to reach the fort.

      <br> <p><h4>Netaji Palkar (1620–1681) was a Sardar Senapati or Sarnaubat (Commander-in-Chief) under Shivaji, founder of the Maratha empire.
      Netaji Palkar was born in a small village, called Chouk in Khalapur, Maharashtra, India in a Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu family. Netaji's father was a major Jagirdar in Western Maharashtra under the Adil Shah.<br>
      <br> <br><b>Military career</b><br> <br>
      Palkar was made Sarnaubat in the year 1657 after the death of Mankoji Dahatonde. During the period of the rise of Shivaji from 1645 to 1665, Netaji was given charge of many expeditions which he successfully completed. His greatest success was the campaign against the Adilshah of Bijapur Sultanate that followed the killing of Afzal Khan. His standing among the local population was such that he was known as Prati Shivaji (image of Shivaji). He disturbed lot of area of Mughals till year 1665. As he did not inform about the actions of Jai Singh and Dilerkhan, Shivaji was upset on him. After the 1665 Treaty of Purandar between Jai Singh and Shivaji, Shivaji was forced to give up 23 forts to the Mughals and also fight against the Adilshah of Bijapur.
       During this period, Netaji Palkar defected to the Bijapur forces. It was the strategy of Shivaji so as to reduce his own military power as Aurangzeb wanted Shivaji to fight for him. Thus Shivaji strategised to defect Netaji Palkar to Adilshah of Bijapur. Therefore as expected by Shivaji, Mughals were unable to conquer Adilshah.
After Shivaji's meeting with Aurangzeb at Agra, Netaji Palkar joined the service of Jaisingh. When Shivaji escaped from Agra, Mirza Raja fell out of favor of Aurangzeb.
      
        <br> <br><b>Capture by the Mughals, conversion to Islam and re-conversion to Hinduism</b><br> <br>
        After Shivaji's escape from Agra, Aurangzeb, as a revenge, ordered Jai Singh to arrest Netaji Palkar. He was under arrest at Dharur fort for a few days. Also it is told that on the same fort Jijabai, Shivaji's mother, sent some money to Jaisingh when demanded by Shivaji to distribute sweets in Agra. Netaji Palkar was then converted to Islam. His wives were thereafter brought to Delhi and also converted for him to remarry them in the Islamic way. Taking up the name of Muhammed Kuli Khan, Netaji Palkar was appointed as garrison commander of the Kandahar fort in Afghanistan.[citation needed] He tried to escape but was traced and trapped at Lahore. Thereafter on the battlefields of Kandhar and Kabul, he fought for the Mughals against rebel Pathans. Thus he gained the good faith of Aurangzeb and was sent to the Deccan along with Commander Diler Khan to conquer Shivaji's territory.

However, after entering Maharashtra, Netaji joined Shivaji's troops and went to Raigad. Thus, after a decade in Mughal captivity, Netaji turned up at the court of Shivaji, asking to be taken back into the Hindu fold. He was not only converted back to Hinduism but into his own community of CKP as well.He died in 1681.
        <br> <br><b>Military campaigns</b><br> <br>
        Netaji led battles against the Adilshah at Panhala, Shahapur, Tikona and Vijapur (Bijapur) in 1660 and at Khatav, Mangalvedha, Phaltan, Taathvada, and Bijapur in 1665.

      <br>
      <p><h4>Yesaji Kank was a childhood comrade of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who was the founder of the Maratha Empire. Kank was born in the foothills of Rajgad. His father, Dadoji Kank, had served in the army of Shahaji.<br><br>
       
        <br> <br><b> Role in Chhatrapati Shivaji's army</b><br> <br>
        Kank was the head of the foot soldiers in the army of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, specializing in guerilla warfare techniques. From childhood until the death of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, he remained loyal to the crown, and played a major role in the Battle of Pratapgad. Kank was also part of a council meeting known as Sadar, and even fought a elephant for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Yesaji was one of the most trusted partners that Maharaj had.
        <br> <br><b>Legacy</b><br> <br>
        Yesaji Kank originated from Rajghar, a village situated at the extreme foothold of Rajgad. Letters written by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and sent to his bhutonde address clearly indicate that he was from Rajghar.[citation needed] Known as the "Sardar Sarnobat"of an army of more than 1.35 million men (mavale), his bravery has been proved in front of all the four Kingdoms of India during 1600 CE.[citation needed] He had fought a drunk elephant in front of Qutubshahi, planned the journey of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to and from Agra Darbar, fought at Fonda fort, and lost his son, Krushnaji Kank. His descendants still live in the ancient wada in his village. The late Mr. Rambhau Kank was a known personality in Maharashtra for all his work and progress he has given to the region. His descendant is Mr. Ravindra Shripatrao Kank lives in Bhor, Pune.

      <br>
      <p><h4>Bahirji Naik was an Indian spy and military commander in the army of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj during a time when the Maratha Empire and Mughal Empire were at war. He is assumed to be a Maratha by his clan name Jadhav, but there is a tradition which claims him to be of the Ramoshi community, whose members were known for their resilience and as strong fighters.[1][2][3]

Bahirji Naik, Chhatrapati Shivaji's Chief of Intelligence, was reasonably successful in his methods.[4] His tomb is currently situated on Bhupalgad (Banurgad) in Khanapur taluka of Sangli district. He was born in the village of Shingave Naik Tal Nagar, Ahmednagar. In 1692, Bahirji's son, Tukoji Naik, built Ram Mandir and the outer border of the Shingave Village. A stone bearing an inscription of his name is kept in the Ram Mandir.

Not much is or was known about the early life of Bahirji, except that his expeditions and adventures as a spy in Chhatrapati Shivaji's maharaj army greatly contributed to the success of the Maratha Empire.[5] Bahirji was skilled at gathering detailed information about every aspect of his missions, and a lion's share of credit for many of chattrapati Shivaji's surprising feats must go to Bahirji Naik and his people.<br>
       
       
        <br> <br><b>Role during wars</b><br> <br>
        It is said that when a knight from Adil Shah, Afzalkhan, started his journey towards the Maratha Empire in order to capture it, Bahirji poisoned the lead flag-bearing elephants. This led to the enemy abandoning the quest. (The death of a flag-bearing elephant was considered a bad omen.) Bahirji further helped Shivaji by mounting many covert operations and acts of sabotage in enemy territory.[citation needed]

In Umbar Khind, a mountain pass near Lonavala, Shivaji ambushed and defeated the 20,000-strong army of Colonel Kartalab Khan, a well-known military officer of Shahistekhan, in the Battle of Umberkhind. This victory is attributed to Bahirji's intelligence collection. Shivaji captured valuable military equipment and accepted the deserters from Khan's army into his own.
        <br> <br><b>Role during covert operations</b><br> <br>
        Shivaji made a surprise attack on Shahistekhan in Khan's military camp at Pune under the cover of darkness to kill Khan and thus demoralize his army. Khan survived this daring attack but lost three fingers. Shivaji escaped to Sinhagad, while drawing Khan's army into a wild chase to a mountain pass in Katraj. Khan did not die, but he and his army were thoroughly demoralized by the campaign. Within three days of Shivaji's failed assassination, Khan left Pune.
        <br> <br><b>Role during invasions</b><br> <br>
        Bahirji Naik was a key person in Shivaji's many surprise victories and escapes. Despite having a smaller army, Shivaji attacked Surat, Aurangzeb's financial capital,twice,once in 1664 and later in 1670,and carried away much of its wealth as recompense for the costs incurred and pain suffered by Shivaji's citizens during the years of occupation by Aurangzeb's army.None of the ordinary citizens of Surat were attacked or looted.

Shivaji escaped from Aurangzeb's jail in Agra, even though the jail itself was surrounded by a 1,000-strong army under an able commander, and subsequently traveled 700 miles through Aurangzeb's kingdom to complete his escape.

In a second expedition to Surat, Colonel Ikhlas Khan chased Shivaji's army to Kanchan Bari (near Nasik), where they engaged in open battle. Khan was unable to maintain the advantage of surprise and lost; Shivaji captured valuable military equipment from Khan due to his victory in the six-hour battle.

      <img src="images/Warriors/MW14.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:20%;height:30%;">
      <br>
      <p><h4>Kanhoji Jedhe was a 17th-century Marathi warrior, and a trusted follower of Shahaji, and of Shahaji's son Shivaji who founded the Maratha Empire in 1674. Kanhoji came from a village named Kari, in present day Bhor taluka, near Pune. He was respected among the Deshmukhs, noblemen in the area. Kanhoji was some 20 years older than Shivaji. Shahaji sent Kanhoji along with the young Shivaji to Pune. Because of his high personal standing among the Jamindars, he helped Shivaji Maharaj in organising most of them under his banner.<br>
      His actual testing time came when Afzal Khan, a Sardar sent by Bijapur court, came to attack Shivaji. Adilshah had threatened all the Deshmukhs of the Maval region to support Afzal or else perish. Kanhoji not only stood by Shivaji, but managed to keep nearly all the Deshmukhs on Shivaji Maharaj's side. After Afzal was defeated soundly at the Battle of Pratapgad, Shivaji Maharaj honored the loyalty and bravery of Kanhoji by awarding him talwarichya pahilya panache maankari (Sword of Honour).

<br><br>Kanhoji demonstrated his own magnanimity after the Battle of Pavan Khind. Immediately after Afzul Khan's death during the encounter with Shivaji Maharaj, Siddi Jauhar, a great warrior, was sent to defeat Shivaji. To protect the citizens of the Maratha Empire, Shivaji decided to stay at Panhala Fort (near Kolhapur) which was at the boundary so that Siddi Jauhar's attack would not take him into the territory. Jauhar then surrounded Panhala with an army of forty thousand. When all other attempts to break Jauhar's siege failed, Shivaji decided to escape secretly. In the monsoon season, Shivaji and a small escort of soldiers crossed the siege line one night during heavy rain. However, Jauhar's army soon realized that he had escaped, and Jauhar sent soldiers under Siddi Masoud to catch Shivaji. After more than half a day's pursuit Siddi Masoud came very close to Shivaji and his escort. Then Baji Prabhu Deshpande, a senior warrior with Shivaji, convinced Shivaji to continue his travel towards Vishalgad while Baji Prabhu along with few warriors of Bandal clan held the narrow passage called Ghod-khind (Horse Pass).<br><br>
 Baji Prabhu and his men fought with Jauhar's army and prevented them from crossing the pass. When Shivaji reached fort Vishalgad, defeating Surve Sawant's siege, he notified Baji Prabhu by firing three cannon shots. By now Baji Prabhu and his army were tired as they had been fighting for more than six hours, and Baji Prabhu had suffered many wounds. He died shortly after hearing the three cannon shots, realizing that Shivaji Maharaj had reached safety at Vishalgad. Shivaji was very sad to lose such a brave and loyal warrior. To honor Baji Prabhu, he wished to give the honor of talwarichya pahilya panache maankari – which had been held by Kanhoji after Afzal's defeat – to Baji Prabhu's Bandal clan. When Shivaji expressed this desire to Kanhoji, he agreed to it without hesitation. This was a great deed by Kanhoji, considering the fact that Kanhoji Jedhe and the Bandal clan had been great enemies until a few years before this incident.

Kanhoji Jedhe also played a pivotal part in bringing Shivaji back from Agra where he was under house arrest.

As per the instructions of Rajmata Jijabai and Chhatrapatishivajimaharaj he led the maratha force for the battle of Purandar resulting in the first victory for the Hindavi Swarajya.

Baji Pasalkar is a regent of 84 Mose Khore and 12 maval . His region started from the village of Nigde Mose to Sagaroon, from Daveja to Dhaman-Ovhol villages had their livelihood. The brave baji was even better in the court. They were clever to solve problems.<br>
       
       
        <br> <br><b>Battle Against Fattekhan</b><br> <br>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had started establishing Swarajya. ShahajiRaje had got the jahagir of Pune. Under the guidance of Jijau-aisaheb and ShahajiRaje, Shivaji started acquiring a fort in Maval. In Adilshahi court of Bijapur, the news of Shiva's formation of Swaraj came to light. Adilshah sent Fatte khan in 1647 to arrange for Shivaji Maharaj.

Fattekhan had his base in Belasar near Jejuri. Khans forces attacked the fort on the banks of Shirval. This was the first defeat of the Marathas.. Then Baji Palskar, Kanhoji Jedhe, Godaji Jagtap went to the camp of Balsar to attack Fatekhan, suddenly attacked and slaughtered the Khan`s force and reached Purandar's place.

Fatekhan's head Mussikhan attacked Purandar, and the siege of Purandar Khan's army fell. There was a battle between Fatte Khan's army and Marathas near the fort lead by Baji Pasalkar as the Sarsenapati. Baji Pasalkar, Kanhoji Jedhe, Godaji Jagtap slaughtered guanim. Fattekhan's leader Mussikhan and Godaji Jagtap clashed together. Baji Pasalkar alone chased fattekhan as fattekhan ran away from the battle. There was a cold war between the two. Marathas won the first Ranigram of Swarajya but a hero like Baji Pasalkar fell.
        <br> <br>During the Battle of Purandar, Fattekhan left the war and started running, Baji alone without any army chased Fattekhan till Belsar. Khan taking advantage of the situation attacked Baji with his force resulting in the death of the first Sarsenapati of the maratha Empire.Due to the sacrifice of Baji Pasalkar, the ideal of sacrificing everything in the mind of Swaraj was created. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a memorial(Smarak) of Baji Pasalkar in Belsar, near Jejuri. <br>

      <br>
      <p><h4>Firangoji Narsala was a Maratha warrior and military leader in the army of Shivaji, in 17th century India. He is famous for his defence of Sangram Durg, a fort, against a Mughal army led by Shaista Khan in 1660 .

Firangoji was a 'Killedar' (fortress commander) of this fort in Chakan (Pune). When Shaista Khan invaded Pune with a lakh of soldiers, he selected Sangram Durga as the first target. He attacked the fort with 20,000 soldiers on 23 June 1660.

<br><br>Firangoji Narasala was prepared for this attack, however, even though he had only 320 soldiers. Just before this attack Shivaji had asked his commander to leave the fort. However, Firangoji decided not to abandon the fort and instead started a fierce guerrilla war against the Mughals and defended the fort in this way for 56 days. War ended on 14 August 1660.

The Mughals tried another way of taking the fort. They dug a tunnel up to the fort; which was a challenge because of the water around it. They filled this tunnel with explosives and blew up the wall of the fort. This was a major setback for Firangoji and his soldiers; 75 soldiers died in this attack. The Mughal army rushed into the fort; fierce fighting ensued and many Maratha soldiers were killed.

Shaista Khan was astonished by Firangoji's bravery, and offered him Mughal Sardari. But Firangoji refused to accept it; instead Shaista Khan gave him and his soldiers safe passage. Firangoji came to meet Shivaji and apologised for surrendering the fort. But Shivaji was very happy with him as he had defended a small fort for almost 2 months. He said "if it took 60 days for Shaista Khan to take a small fort, imagine how many days will be required to capture an entire swarajya (kingdom). 
Shaista Khan will be here for few days, he is not going to take Sangram Durg with him. Whatever you have done is praiseworthy". 
Shivaji rewarded Firangoji and made him Killedar of the Bhupalgad (Bhupal fort).<br>

      <br>
      <p><h4>Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande (Marathi: बापुजी मुदगल देशपांडे; 1608–1665) was a general in the early Maratha Empire during the reign of Shivaji.<br>
       
      The Deshpande family warriors never had firm directions before 1636 and they used engaged in battles sometime from side of Adilshah or from Nizamshah. The Deshpande family had a light infantry of 500 people consisting of local Mahadev Koli, Ramoshi and Marathas.

It was 1636 when, the family met Jijabai, Konde Deshmukh and Dadoji Konddeo offered their own Wada to stay to the Bhonsales.

Bapuji Mugdal belonged to this family that came from a Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu i.e. CKP community of Maharashtra. The family's original name was Narhekar and obtained the name Deshpande because they were the Deshpandes of Khedebare.
This family supported and encouraged idea of new village development of Khed Shivapur.
        <br> <br><b>First recapturing of Kondhana in 1647</b><br> <br>
        By using force of his military, Bapuji removed Adilshahi, the Kiladar of Kondhana,, and started Swarajya’s rule over there. Later Muse Khan made complaint to Adilshaha about this incident as a response Sultan sent small army headed by the Ghorpades (who used to hate Bhonsale family) but Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande, Dadoji Konddeo, 18-year-old Shivaji convinced Ghorpade about their action, Ghorpades believed to punish Dadoji Konddeo by cutting his one hand as he sided the Bhonsale’s wing in spite of servant of Adilshah.
        <br> <br><b>Second recapturing of Kondhana in 1656</b><br> <br>
        After giving Kondhana fort to Adilshaha in 1650, Shivaji realized the need to have control of this strategically important fort near Pune. He ordered Bapuji to look on to this matter. Bapuji had unique idea to handle this issue without war, he convinced Muslim Kiladar of Kondhana by offering huge “Inam” tax free land near Khed Shivapur village in return of this fort’s control and thus avoided battle and blood lash. Shivaji got so impressed when he came to know the way by which Bapuji got this fort, he paid good reward to him and kept “Karkhanishi” of fort to Deshpande family.
        His son Keso Narayan Deshpande fought in Purandar fort’s battle during 1670 and successfully recaptured this fort but was unfortunately killed in the battle in the hands of Mirad Khan who was Kiladar of Purandar. Later Shivaji Raje awarded Mujumdari (Administrative Post) of fort and area from Pune to Baramati to Niliopant Mujumdar of Pune.

      <br>
      <p><h4>Prataprao Gujar/Gurjar born in Khatav which is located in Satara district to a Gurjar family. He was Senapati of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's army. After his death, his daughter was married with the second son of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj named Rajaram, who was later to be the Empress of the Maratha Empire, Maharani Jankibai Gujar or Gurjar

Prataprao Gujar was born as Kudtoji Gujar into a Gurjar family which is classified amongst immigrant family (clan) stock in Marathas.[1] He was the third royal Senapati of King Chatrapti's army, which was probably the most successful guerrilla force in 17th century India. He was given the title of Prataprao (the brave) by King chatrapti in acknowledgement of his bravery in the war against Mirza Jai Singh.

He was a highly gifted aristocratic general, who enjoyed the trust of his king and the loyalty of his troops. He defeated a large Mughal Army at the famous Battle of Salher. Salher was a major battle between the Mughals and the Marathas, and the first large-scale pitched battle between the two in open field. The victory of the Marathas at Salher is seen as a definitive turning point in their military prowess against the mighty force of the Mughals. Prataprao Gujar's major drawback was his impulsive emotional nature.

<br> <br> <br> <br>A few months before Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's coronation in 1674, Prataprao Gujar was sent to deal with the invading force led by the Adilshahi General Bahalol Khan. The Maratha Army surrounded the camp of Bahalol Khan at the place of Nesari. Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the battle. In spite of specific warnings against doing so by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Prataprao released Bahalol Khan along troops and the seized war material, when Bahalol Khan promised not to invade Maratha territories again. Days after his release, Bahalol Khan started preparing for a fresh invasion.

When Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj heard of about Prataprao decision, he was incensed and wrote an angry letter to Prataprao refusing him permission to see him till such time, until Bahlol Khan was re-captured. Prataprao realised his mistake and was so upset about what he had done that he now wanted to capture Bahlol Khan at any cost.

<br> <br> <br> <br>On 24 February 1674, he learnt that Mughal general Bahlol Khan was camping nearby. Prataprao decided to make a stand against Balol Khan at Nesari. Prataprao Gujar with 1200 troops were against Khan with 15000. So, Prataprao reasoned that there was no point in taking 1200 men to suicide with him. So, in a fit of anger and overreacting to the letter, he left alone, without asking his cavalry to charge. It was his personal honour at stake, not his army. On seeing their leader head to certain death, 6 other Maratha sardars joined him in the charge, they attacked the enemy camp, and were slaughtered. Anandrao and Hansaji Mohite stayed back. It was an impulsive decision and the loss of Prataprao Gujar was a big loss to the Marathas. Anandrao Mohite managed to take the Maratha Army to safer areas.

Maratha Army avenged the death of their general, by defeating Bahlol Khan and looting his jagir (fiefdom) under the leadership of Anandrao and Hambirrao Mohite. Hambirrao Mohite became the new Sarnaubat (Commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces).

Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was deeply grieved and saddened on hearing of Prataprao Gujar's death. <br>

These were carried in huge baskets each slung from a pole which was borne by two men on their shoulders.

The guards searched the baskets for some days and then began to let them pass out unchallenged. This was the opportunity for which Shivaji Maharaj had been waiting. <br>
       
       
        <br> <br><b>The final escape:</b><br> <br>
        In the afternoon of 19th August 1966, he sent word to his guards that he was very ill and had taken to his bed and that they should not disturb him. His half-brother Hiroji Farzand, who looked somewhat like him, lay down on his cot, with a quilt covering all of his body except the outstretched right arm adorned with Shivaji's gold wristlet, - while Shivaji and his son crouched down in two baskets, which were safely sent out shortly after sunset through the lines of unsuspecting guards, being preceded and followed by baskets of real sweets.
        <br> <br>The boxes reached the outskirts of Agra, in a jungle. There a trusted general of Shivaji awaited his arrival. Then the king, the son and a few others smeared ashes over their bodies like sadhus and headed towards Mathura. 

The next afternoon, Hiroji Farzand walked out as himself along with a trusted aid who was seen pressing Shivaji's Maharaj (the decoy)'s feet the earlier evening, warning the guards to not disturb Maharaj till he returned. 

After a while, the guards got suspicious of the silence in the camp and discovered to their horror that the bird had flown away.

According to tradition, the two leaders Afzal Khan and Shivaji agreed to meet unarmed to discuss a peaceful solution on November 9, 1659. (Both men hid weapons on their persons and brought bodyguards anyway.) When the moment came to greet each other, the towering Khan slid a knife from the inside of his coat and attempted to stab Shivaji in the back. Wearing armor to protect himself, the Maratha king pulled away and swiped bagh nakhi, curved blades in the palm of his hand, across his enemy’s abdomen, slashing through Khan’s organs.

Khan lurched through the curtains of the tent, crying out to his followers he had been attacked. As the Adilshahi guards moved toward Shivaji, Khan was carried off by attendants in an attempt to escape before his life faded away completely. One of Shivaji’s men, Sambhaji Kavji Kondhalkar eventually decapitated the leader.<br>
       
<br> <br>Sambhaji Kaahi was one of the 2 bodyguards of Shivaji Maharaj who had entered in the tent with Shivaji Maharaj. Other one was Jiva Mahala. Sambhaji Kawaji had immense strength and built like Afzal Khan. He can easily bend a steal rod. Shivaji Maharaj choose him because he wanted someone with sheer power and muscles. Shivaji Maharaj had instructed him to never loose him out of sight but when Shivaji Maharaj di-sected Afjal Khan and Afzal Khan started running when his bodyguard Sayyad Banda engaged in fight with Shivaji Maharaj; he went after Afjal Khan and beheaded him.

While Shahista Khan started campaign against Shivaji Maharaj, Sambhaji Kawaji defected to Swarajya and joined Mughals. Pratap rao Gujar, then deputy commander in chief of Swarajya defeated and killed him in a skirmish.
        <br> <br>He was the man who chopped of head of afzal Khan. Sambhaji kawaji was one of the bodyguards of Shivaji maharaj when he went to meet afzal Khan and stabbed him. Afzal Khan's soldiers attempted to rescue him and take him away but sambhaji kawaji chopped if their legs and then chopped of the head of afzal Khan and presented it to Shivaji maharaj.

      <br>
      <p><h4>Dhanaji Jadhav[1] (1650[1]–1708) was a warrior of the Maratha Empire. Along with Santaji Ghorpade he made terrifying campaigns against Mughal Army from 1689 to 1696. After Santaji, Dhanaji became the chief of the Maratha army in 1696 and remained on the post until his death in 1708.
      Dhanaji was born in or around 1650, to the Maratha family from Sindh khed to Santaji Jadhav.[1] Dhanaji was brought up by Shivaji's mother Jijabai after assassination of Dhanaji's grandfather Achloji, who was Jijabai's brother. Santaji's son Shambhu (Sambhaji) also was brought up by Jijabai with her son Shivaji after Santaji's martyrdom at the Battle of Pavan Khind with Baji Prabhu Deshpande
       
        <br> <br>At an early age, Dhanaji joined Maratha army under Shivaji's Military Chief Prataprao Gujar.[1] In the battles at Umbrani and Nesari, Dhanaji's performance attracted attention of Shivaji for the first time. He was named by Shivaji on his death bed among six pillars of Maratha Empire who would save the kingdom in hard times. They would end up with success in the 27 Years War between Mughal forces of Aurangzeb and the Maratha forces.

        <br> <br>In November 1703, Aurangzeb opened talks with Dhanaji through his son Kambaksh to handover Shahu to him. The talks, however, could not succeed due to the so-called extravagant demands by Dhanaji made on behalf of the Maratha king. In 1705, Maratha army containing about 40,000 soldiers headed by Dhanaji, Dado Malhar and Rambhaji Nimbalkar smashed into Surat and looted entire region of Gujarat up to Bharuch. Dhanaji also vanquished the Mughal army under Nazar Ali, the Nawab of Baroda, at Ratanpur and brought huge treasure to Maharashtra.

In 1708, with mediation by his assistant Balaji Vishwanath,[2] who would later become Peshwa in 1713, Dhanaji left Tarabai and joined hands with Shahu at Khed. Soon thereafter he died, because of leg injury, in Vadgaon (Kolhapur). Subsequently, his son Chandrasen Jadhavrao was placed on his post.
