  <p><h2>The Hindawi Swaraj formed by
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a State
for the people, founded with the noble
intention of the welfare of common
people, removal of oppression and the
protection of Maharashtra Dharma. In the
period after Shivaji Maharaj, Maratha
power spread to all parts of India. It
lasted for about 150 years.</h2></p>
<div>
        <p><h4>At the beginning of the seventeenth
century CE, most of the territory in
Maharashtra was under the control of
Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar and Adilshah
of Bijapur. The Mughals had entered
Khandesh. Their objective was to expand
their power in the south. There were
settlements of Siddi people, who had come
from Africa, along the coastline of Konkan.
The competition and conflict amongst the
Portuguese, the British, the French and the
Dutch, who had come from Europe, was
getting intense during this period. There
was stiff competition amongst them to
capture the markets for trade. The Portuguese
had already established their rule in Goa
and Vasai on the western coastline. The
British, the Dutch and the French had found
an entry through the medium of trading
companies by setting up factories. All these
powers assessed the strength of other
powers, kept themselves safe and tried to
dominate as much as possible. This conflict
had created instability and insecurity in
Maharashtra. These different people from
Europe were called ‘Topkar’ on the basis
of their customary headgear.
It is necessary to get acquainted with
the village (mauja), Kasba and pargana to
understand the nature of settlements in that
period as also of the officers that formed a
link between the rulers and their subjects,
and also the markets and the craftsmen.
Pargana was made up of many villages.
Generally, the headquarters of a pargana
was called ‘Kasba’. A village smaller than
a Kasba was called ‘Mauja’. Let us get
acquainted in brief with Village, Kasba and
Pargana respectively.</h4>
<br>
<h2>Village (Mauja) :</h2><h4> Most of the people
lived in villages. A village was also called
mauja. The chief of the village was the
Patil. He used to try to bring maximum
land under cultivation. When there was
any dispute in the village, the Patil resolved
it and made peace. A Kulkarni helped the
Patil in his work. The Kulkarni kept the
record of the revenue that was collected.
There were various artisans in the village.
They had hereditary rights regarding their
occupation. The peasants gave a share of
their agricultural produce to the artisans
for the services they rendered to the village
community. This share was known as
baluta.</h4>
<br>

<h2>Kasba :</h2><h4> A kasba was like a big village.
It was usually the headquarters of a
pargana, e.g., Indapur kasba of Indapur
pargana, Wai kasba of Wai pargana were
the headquarters of those parganas.
Agriculture was the main occupation. There
were skilled artisans like carpenters,
blacksmiths, etc. in a kasba. There was
usually a market (peth) adjacent to a kasba.
The Shete and Mahajan were the watandars
of the peth. Every village did not necessarily
have a peth. The setting up of a peth was
the job of the Shetes and the Mahajans. For
that, they received some land from the
government and some rights from the
villagers.</h4>
<br>
<h2> The Mahaj Kasba :</h2><h4> A kasba was like a big village.
It was usually the headquarters of a
pargana, e.g., Indapur kasba of Indapur
pargana, Wai kasba of Wai pargana were
the headquarters of those parganas.
Agriculture was the main occupation. There
were skilled artisans like carpenters,
blacksmiths, etc. in a kasba. There was

have a peth. The setting up of a peth was
the job of the Shetes and the Mahajans. For
that, they received some land from the
government and some rights from the
villagers. The Mahajan maintained the
accounts of the peth. </h4>
<br>
<h2>Pargana :</h2> 
<h4>Many villages together
made a pargana. But the number of
villages was not the same in all parganas.
For example, the Pune pargana was a big
pargana. It consisted of 290 villages.
There were 64 villages in the Chakan
pargana. The Shirwal pargana was small.
It had only 40 villages. The Deshmukh
and the Deshpande were the watandar
officers of the pargana. The Deshmukh
was the chief of patils in a pargana. The
Deshmukh did at the pargana level, what
the Patil did at the village level. The
Deshpande was the chief of all Kulkarnis
in the pargana. The Deshpande did at the
pargana level, the work that Kulkarnis
did at the village level. These watandar
officers were the link between the people
and the government.
In case of enemy invasion or drought,
these watandars represented the grievances
of the people to the government.
Sometimes, these officers misused their
powers. They collected more money from
the people than was due or did not remit
the money so collected to the government
in time. On such occasions, the people
suffered harassment. 
       </h4> 
<h2>The calamity of a famine :
 </h2>
<h4>Agriculture was dependent on rainwater.If it did not rain, crops would fail. The
prices of foodgrains rose. It became
difficult for the people to get foodgrains
and other things. There was no fodder for
the cattle. Water became scarce. It became
difficult for people to live in the village.
They were forced to leave the village. A
famine was a great calamity for the
people.
A great famine occurred in
Maharashtra in 1630 ce. People were
greatly distressed due to this famine. It
has been described in these words –
‘People were ready to sell themselves for
a piece of bhakri, but there was nobody
to buy them’. There was a severe scarcity
of foodgrains. Entire families were
destroyed. Cattle and farm animals died.
Agriculture was devastated. The famine
put an end to industries. All financial
transactions came to a standstill. People
had to wander to faraway regions in
search of a livelihood. It was a great
challenge to bring back to normalcy, the
devastated life of the people.

<h1>The work of the Varkari movement:</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Society was greatly influenced by blind
beliefs and rituals. People had become
fatalistic and inert. They had lost all
initiative. The condition of the common
people was miserable. In such
circumstances, the Sants in Maharashtra
endeavoured to inspire the masses.
In Maharashtra, the tradition of Sants
which began with Sant Dnyaneshwar and
Sant Namdeo was carried on by Sants
coming from various strata of the society.
People from all strata of society were
part of the Sant tradition. For example,
Sant Chokhamela, Sant Goroba, Sant
Sena, Sant Sawata, Sant Narhari, Sant
Shaikh Muhammad, etc. Sant Chokhoba’s
wife Sant Soyrabai, and sister Sant
Nirmalabai, Sant Muktabai, Sant Janabai,
Sant Kanhopatra, Sant Bahinabai Siurkar
and other women were also among them.
Pandharpur was at the centre of the Sant
movement. Vitthal was the object of their
worship. On the banks of the river
Chandrabhaga at Pandharpur, the Sants
and pilgrims (varkari) used to rejoice in
their devotion (bhakti). There, equality
was propagated through bhajans, keertans,
and unity meals (kala).</h4>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Sant Namdeo :</h2>
<hr>
<img src="images/A&C/SN.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:18%;height:50%;">
<br>
<h4>He was a great Sant
of the Varkari movement. He was a skilled
organiser. He performed excellent keertans
as well. He awakened
the sense of equality in
men and women
belonging to all castes
through the medium of
keertans. His pledge
was ‘नाचू कीर्तनाचे रंगी  ।
ज्ञानदीप लावू जगी।।’ His
abhanga compositions
are well-known. Many
Sants as well as common people were
influenced by his teachings. He went up to
the Punjab, propagating his thoughts. His
compositions are included in the ‘Guru
Granth Sahib’ of Sikhs. He propagated the
message of Bhagwat religion in all quarters.
He built a memorial to Sant Chokhamela
at Pandharpur. His work is unforgettable</h4>

<h2>Sant Dnyaneshwar :</h2>
<hr>
<img src="images/A&C/SD.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:18%;height:50%;">
<br>
<h4>He was a great
Sant in the Varkari movement. He wrote
the ‘Bhavartha-deepika’ or ‘Dnyaneshwari’
which elucidates the meaning of the
Sanskrit ‘Bhagavad
Geeta’. He also
composed the
‘Amrutanubhav’.
He preached the
importance of the
path of devotion
through his works
and compositions.
He showed a simple way of worship and conduct which the
common people could follow easily. He
gave the prestige of a religion to the
Varkari movement. Though his life was
spent in extremely adverse circumstances,
he never lost the calm of his mind and
never harboured bitterness. His
‘Pasayadaan’ in Dnyaneshwari uplifts the
mind. The poetic compositions of his
brothers Sant Nivruttinath and Sant
Sopandev and sister Muktabai are wellknown. </h4>

<br>
<h4>He was a great Sant of
the Bhakti movement
in Maharashtra. His
compositions are
many and diverse.
They include abhanga,
gavalana, bharud, etc.
He has stated Bhagvat
Dharma in detail and
in a simple manner.
He has portrayed
people’s life in
Bhavarth Ramayana through the story of
Ram. He explained in Marathi, the Bhakti
part of the Sanskrit work ‘Bhagwat’. His
abhangas show the warmth of devotion. He
demonstrated through his own conduct that
there is no need to renounce worldly matters
for attaining the highest truth, Paramarth.
He was a teacher of the people in the true
sense of the term. He believed that our
Marathi language was inferior to no other
language. He asked the Sanskrit Scholars
forcefully. ‘संस्कृत वाणी देवे केली । तरी प्राकृत काय
चोरापासुनि झाली ?’ He heavily criticised those
who hated other religions.</h4>

<h2>Sant Tukaram :</h2>
<hr>
<img src="images/A&C/ST.png" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:15%;height:25%;">
<br>
<h4>He belonged to
Dehu near Pune. His compositions or
abhangas are very pleasing and lucid,
reaching the greatest poetic heights. His
‘Gatha’ is a precious treasure of the
Marathi language. He asks us to find God by showing love to the unhappy and
the tormented in the following lines : ‘जे
का रंजले गांजले  । त्यांसी म्हणे जो आपुले । तोचि
साधु ओळखावा  । देव तेथेचि जाणावा   ।।’ With
this viewpoint, he threw in the river
Indrayani, the documents of the loans
that people had borrowed from him and
freed many poor
families from the
bonds of loan. He
criticized the
hypocrisy and
superstition in the
society in very strong
terms. He stressed
that devotion (Bhakti)
should be coupled
with morality. His teachings can be
summed up as ‘जोडोनिया धन उत्तम व्यवहारे ।
उदास विचारे वेच करी ।।’ Some dogmatic
people opposed the social awakening that
he had undertaken, and sank his abhangas
in the Indrayani. Sant Tukaram faced the
opposition with noble courage.
Sant Tukaram’s disciples and
associates were of different castes and
creeds. They include Navji Mali,
Gavnarshet Wani, Santaji Jagnade, Shivba
Kasar, Bahinabai Siurkar and
Mahadajipant Kulkarni. An important
task completed by Gangarampant Maval
and Santaji Jagnade was writing down
the abhangas of Sant Tukaram.

<h2>Work of Sants :</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Sants gave the
message of equality to people. They
taught humanity. They preached that
people should live together in harmony,
unity and love. Their work resulted in
social awakening. They taught how to
live in the face of foreign invasions,
drought-like situations or any other natural
calamities. Their teachings proved to be
a big support for people. Their work
created self-confidence among the people of Maharashtra.
There was a deterioration of ethics
and religion in the society. At such a
time, the Sants came forward to protect
the society. They taught the true meaning
of religion. They showed the path of
devotion by living amongst people and
sharing their joys and sorrows. Some
orthodox and dogmatic people opposed
them. But the Sants believed that facing
this opposition was a part of their duty.
Sant Tukaram has explained the mark of
a true Sant in these words – ‘तुका म्हणे
तोचि संत । सोशी जगाचे आघात ।।’
The Sants elucidated the complex
dharma of the scholars (Shastris and
Pandits) in the language of the people.
They prayed to God using simple,
everyday terms. They took the view that
all are equal before God. They taught
society to do away with the pride arising
out of caste and varna and see everyone
as God’s children. A characteristic of the
Sants was that they did not forget their
duties on the path of devotion. They
found God in their work. Sant Sawata
said, ‘कांदा मुळा भाजी । अवघी विठाई माझी  ।।’
This statement refers to farm work but
applies to work in all walks of life. The
Sants carried on with their duties even as
they were engaged in devotion, teaching
and composing verses. They developed
the moral sensibilities of the society.</h4>

fitness to the people,
‘मराठा तितुका मेळवावा   ।

This message of
Ramdas Swami is
famous. He gave
practical education
and lessons in good conduct through his
works like Dasbodh, Karunashtaka,
Manache Shlok. He stated the importance
of people’s movement and organisation
and founded the Samarth Sampradaya.
Chaphal was the centre of this Sampradaya.
He propagated the worship of Ram and
Hanuman. He travelled far and wide to
propagate his thoughts.

also received a part of the village revenue.
The balutedars were paid in kind (in the
form of objects, foodgrains, etc.) for the
work they did for the village people. The
village occupations were divided into kali
and pandhari. Peasants worked in their
fields in the kali (land, earth or soil) and
others, in pandhari - within the village
precincts. It was considered important to

farmers were limited. They grew jowar,
bajra, wheat, ragi (nachani), maize, rice
and other grains in their fields. The daily
diet consisted of bhakari, onion, chutney
and an accompaniment. Barter system was
used for everyday transactions. Village
houses were simple mud and brick
constructions. Wadas with one or two
storeys were seen in cities. Rice, dal,
chapatis, vegetables, salads, milk and dahi
products were mainly included in the rich
people’s diet. Men wore a dhoti, kurta,
angarakha and mundase. Women wore
nine-yard sarees and blouses.</h4></p>

<img src="images/A&C/BP.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:15%;height:25%;">
<br>
<p><h4>People celebrated Gudhi
Padwa, Nagpanchmi, Bail-pola, Dasara,
Diwali, Makarsankrant, Holi, Eid and
other festivals. In the Peshwa period,
Ganeshotsava was celebrated in many
homes. The Peshwa himself being a devotee of Ganesha, these celebrations
acquired importance. Every year these
celebrations lasted from Bhadrapad
Chaturthi up to Anant Chaturdashi.
Dasara being considered as one of the
three and a half most auspicious occasions,
many new things were started on this day.
Weapons were offered puja, and it was
customary to cross the boundaries
ceremoniously (seemollanghana) and
distribute ‘apta’ leaves on Dasara. The
Marathas launched their campaigns after
Dasara. During Diwali, Balipratipada and
Bhau-beej celebrations had special
importance. In most of the villages, fairs
were held. Wrestling bouts were a common
feature of the fairs, (jatras). Gudhis were
raised to celebrate Gudhi Padwa.
Celebrations included entertainment
programmes like songs and dances. Tamasha
was a popular form of entertainment.</h4></p>

<br>
<p><h4>The two
major religions seen in this period were
Hindu and Muslim. Chhatrapati Shivaji
Maharaj had a liberal religious policy.
The general understanding was that
everyone should follow their own religion
and should not impose it on others. The
government gave grants to pathshalas,
temples, madarasas and mosques.
Followers of both religions took part in
the celebration of each other’s festivals.
Varkari, Mahanubhav, Datta, Nath and
Ramdasi panths were prevalent.</h4></p>

<br>
<p><h4>We find references to
restoration of Kasba Ganapati Mandir,
building of the Lal Mahal, construction
on Rajgad and Raigad, building of sea
forts, etc. that are related to architecture.
Hiroji Indulkar was a famous architect of
that period.
While setting up a village, the usual
pattern was : roads cutting one another
at right angles, stone construction along
the sides and extensive ghats (steps) along
the river bank. During the Peshwa period,
a drinking water supply system was built
like the one at Ahmadnagar and Bijapur.
The Peshwas built underground pipes,
small dams, gardens and courts, tanks,
fountains, etc. The Mastani Talav at
Diveghat, Hadapsar near Pune city is
worth a mention in this regard.
Shaniwarwada and Vishrambagwada
in Pune, Sarkarwada in Nashik,
Raghunathrao Peshwa’s wada at
Kopargaon, the wadas of the Satara
Chhatrapati, as also the old wadas at Wai,
Menvali, Toke, Shrigonde, Pandharpur are
symbols of the medieval wada culture.
Baked as well as unbaked bricks
were used to build the wadas. Wooden
columns, rafts, boards, dressed stones,
arches, finely prepared lime, round tiles
for the roof, mud and bamboo were all
used in the construction. The wadas were
decorated with sketches, paintings, wooden
sculptures and mirrors.

Important specimens
include the sculpture of the meeting
between Mallamma Desai and Shivaji
Maharaj at the time of his Karnataka
campaign, the sculpture at Bhuleshwar
temple including sculptures of individuals
and animals (e.g., elephant, peacock,
monkey), the sculptures on the Toke temple
and the idols within, the Trishund Ganapati 
temple in Pune, the memorial to Punyashlok
Ahilyabai in Madhya Pradesh, the
sculptures at the Mohiniraj temple at
Newase. 
<br>
<b>Metal idols :</b> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Peshwas had
specially commissioned the metal idols of
Parvati and Ganapati in the Parvati temple
for the purpose of Puja. Wooden sculptures
were also seen.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The temples of this period
are build in the Hemadpanti style of the Yadav period. The shikhar of the Ambabai
temple at Kolhapur, the temples on the
Jotiba hill, Shambhu Mahadev temple at
Shikhar-Shinganapur, Ghrishneshwar
temple at Verul are excellent specimens of
sculpture. The Bhavanidevi temple on
Pratapgad and the Saptkoteshwar temple
at Goa were built by Shivaji Maharaj.
Other temples of the Peshwa period are the Kalaram temple at Nashik, the Shiva
temple at Trimbakeshwar, the Shiva
temples at Kaygaon and Toke on the
confluence of the Godavari and Pravara,
and the Mohiniraj temple at Newase.

<p><h4>Stone ghats built on a river or
at the confluence of rivers are characteristic
of Maratheshahi. The most remarkable
specimen of a ghat is the one at Toke,
Pravara Sangam on the confluence of the
Godavari and Pravara. In a flight of steps,
there would be one wide step at regular
intervals. This would lend beauty to the
entire ghat construction. Strong bastions
were built at regular intervals so as to
prevent damage due to water currents.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The paintings on the walls
of Shaniwarwada are the important ones
of the Peshwa period. Ragho, Tanaji,
Anuprao, Shivram, Mankoji are some of
the important painters of this period. The
painter Gangaram Tambat was famous at
the time of Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa. The Peshwas encouraged painting. Wadas
in the Pune, Satara, Menvali, Nashik,
Chandwad and Nipani regions during the
Peshwa period had paintings on their
walls. Temples at Pandeshwar, Morgaon,
Pal, Benwadi, Pashan near Pune have
paintings on the walls. The themes of
those paintings were Dashavatara,
Ganapati, Shankar, Rampanchayatana,
mythological stories, Ramayana,
Mahabharata, festivals and so on. At
Jamod in Vidarbha, Jin Charitra paintings
adorned the Jain temple. Illustrations in the
pothis, minatures, portraits, scenes, etc.
were also painted. </h4></p>

literature, owi, abhanga, treatises, narrative
poems, biographies, aaratis of deities,
powadas, bakhars, historical letters, etc.


At Tanjavur in the South,
Marathi plays has emerged near the end of
the seventeenth century. Sarfoji Raje
encouraged this art. Songs, music and
dance were prominent parts of these plays.
So far we reviewed the medieval
period of history and the rise and
expansion of the Maratha power. Next
year, we shall study the modern period.
